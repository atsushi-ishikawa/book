<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculations have become
increasingly important for obtaining insight into characteristics of
flow reactors in particular, which are difficult to obtain
experimentally. The basic equations in the CFD calculations are the
conservation equations, which have been well known for over a century.
However, these equations are inherently nonlinear, making exact
solutions generally unavailable. There are certainly some
fluid-mechanics problems that can be solved exactly, but these analytic
solutions demand approximations such as constant properties. When
chemical reactions are included, exaction solutions are essentially
impossible. The CFD numerically solves these equations with computers,
and makes quantitative analysis and/or visualization of the chemically
complex three-dimensional problems.</p></li>
<li><p>The present book considers only laminar flow, thus completely
neglecting turbulent flow. The applications are generally concerned with
internal flows with small spatial dimensions (i.e. low Reynolds
numbers). Many chemical reactors fall into this regime. Small-scale heat
exchangers and fuel cells are based on the laminar flow in relatively
small channels. Chemical reactors typically rely on catalysts, either in
packed beds or as channel washcoats.</p></li>
<li><p>Any material that deforms continuously under the influence of
shearing forces is called a fluid.</p></li>
<li><p>Generally speaking, a fluid can be a liquid or a gas, where an
important difference is the fluid density, which plays a central role in
fluid mechanics. For gases, however, one needs an equitation of state to
establish the essential relationship among density, temperature,
pressure, and species composition. A liquid is an incompressible fluid,
meaning that the density can be treated as a constant with respect to
the pressure and temperature changes.</p></li>
<li><p>In addition to the equation of state, it is necessary to describe
other thermodynamic properties of the fluid, such as specific heat,
enthalpy, entropy, or free energy.</p></li>
<li><p>Most descriptions of fluid behavior also depends on transport
properties, including viscosity, thermal conductivity, and diffusion
coefficients. These properties generally depend on temperature,
pressure, and mixture composition.</p></li>
<li><p>This book considers only fluids that are isotropic, meaning that
the fluid properties are independent of direction. Such fluids are known
as Newtonian fluids.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="velocity">velocity</h4>
<ul>
<li>Because a fluid is continuously deformable, defining its velocity
takes a care. At the smallest scale the fluid is an ensemble of
molecules. In principle, one can describe the velocity of a fluid in
terms of the velocities of each molecule in the fluid. Obviously, this
would be impractical owing to the extreme numbers of molecules that have
to be considered. Instead, it is appropriate to use a velocity field
that represents an average fluid velocity at very point within a
macroscopic fluid domain.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="fluid-properties">Fluid properties</h3>
<h4 id="ideal-gas">Ideal gas</h4>
<ul>
<li>The ideal-gas equation of state for multicomponent mixtures depends
on the species composition. Representing the composition as either mass
fraction <span class="math inline">Y_k</span> or mole fraction <span
class="math inline">X_k</span> leads to <span class="math display">
\rho = \frac{p}{RT}\frac{1}{\sum Y_k / W_k} =
\frac{p}{RT}\sum_{k=1}^{K}X_k W_k = \frac{p}{RT}\bar{W}
</span> where <span class="math inline">\rho</span> is the mass density
(<span class="math inline">kg m^{-3}</span>), <span
class="math inline">p</span> is the pressure (<span
class="math inline">N m^{-2}</span>), <span class="math inline">T</span>
is the temperature (<span class="math inline">K</span>). The universal
gas constant is <span class="math inline">R = 8.314 J mol^{-1}
K^{-1}</span>. The species molecular mass are <span
class="math inline">W_k</span> (<span class="math inline">kg
mol^{-1}</span>) and <span class="math display">
\bar{W} = \frac{1}{\sum_{k=1}^K Y_k / W_k} = \sum_{k=1}^K X_K W_k
</span> is the average molecular mass.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="thermodynamics">Thermodynamics</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>The first law of thermodynamics for a system, which forms the
fundamental basis for energy balances, may be stated as <span
class="math display">
\frac{d E_t}{dt} = \frac{dW}{dt} + \frac{dQ}{dt}
</span> where <span class="math inline">E_t</span> is the total internal
energy (<span class="math inline">J</span>), <span
class="math inline">dW/dt</span> represents the work <em>done on the
system</em>, and <span class="math inline">dQ/dt</span> is the heat
<em>added to the system</em>. The total internal energy may include
kinetic and potential energy.</p></li>
<li><p>The first law is often more conveniently represented on a
per-unit-mass basis. The specific internal energy and enthalpy are <span
class="math inline">e = E/m</span> and <span class="math inline">h =
H/m</span> (<span class="math inline">J kg^{-1}</span>), respectively.
In this case, <span class="math inline">h = e + pv</span>, where <span
class="math inline">v</span> is the specific volume (<span
class="math inline">m^3 kg^{-1}</span>).</p></li>
<li><p>It is often useful to represent the thermodynamics properties on
a molar basis. Assuming a species with molecular mass <span
class="math inline">W</span>, the molar properties (<span
class="math inline">J mol^{-1}</span>) are <span class="math display">
E = eW, H = hW, S = sW, G = gW, A = aW
</span></p></li>
<li><p>The thermodynamics properties of ideal gases have significant
temperature dependencies.</p></li>
<li><p>Broadly speaking, gas-phase heat capacity increases as a function
of increasing temperature.</p></li>
<li><p>Although a molecule’s heat capacity depends on translational,
rotational, and vibrational contributions, many CDF softwares typically
represent the heat capacities as fits rather than directly evaluating
them from fundamental theories.</p></li>
<li><p>A widely used polynomial fit was first introduced in the NASA
chemical equilibrium program [Ref]. In this case, the standard-state
heat capacity <span class="math inline">C_p^{\rm o}</span> (<span
class="math inline">J mol^{-1} K^{-1}</span>) is represented as <span
class="math display">
\frac{C_p^{\rm o}}{R} = \sum_{n=1}^N a_n T^{n-1}
</span> where <span class="math inline">R</span> is the gas constant and
<span class="math inline">T</span> is temperature. The NASA program and
databases used <span class="math inline">N = 5</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>The standard-state molar enthalpy (<span class="math inline">J
mol^{-1}</span>) is related to the standard-state heat capacity as <span
class="math display">
H^{\rm o} = \int_{298}^{T}C_p^{\rm o}dT + H^{\rm o}(298)
</span> where <span class="math inline">H^{\rm o}(298)</span> is the
standard-state enthalpy at <span class="math inline">T = 298 K</span>.
Assuming heat-capacity fits in the form of Eq.X, enthalpy fits follow as
<span class="math display">
\frac{H^{\rm o}}{RT} = \sum_{n=1}^N \frac{a_n T^{n-1}}{n} +
\frac{a_{N+1}}{T}
</span> where <span class="math inline">a_{N+1}</span> represents <span
class="math inline">H^{\rm o}(298)/R</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>The standard-state molar entropy (<span class="math inline">J
mol^{-1} K^{-1}</span>) is related to the heat capacity as <span
class="math display">
S^{\rm o} = \int_{298}^{T}\frac{C_p^{\rm o}}{T}dT + S^{\rm o}(298)
</span> where <span class="math inline">S^{\rm o}(298)</span> is the
standard-state entropy at <span class="math inline">T = 298K</span>.
Again, assuming heat-capacity fits (Eq.X) <span class="math display">
\frac{S^{\rm o}}{R} = a_1 \ln T + \sum_{n=2}^N \frac{a_n T^{n-1}}{n-1} +
a_{N+2}
</span> where <span class="math inline">a_{N+2}</span> represents <span
class="math inline">S^{\rm o}(298)/R</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Widely used databases catalog the thermodynamic property fits as
<span class="math display">
\begin{align}
\frac{C_p^{\rm o}}{R} &amp;= a_1 + a_2 T + a_3 T^2 + a_4 T^3 + a_5 T^4
\\
\frac{H^{\rm o}}{RT}  &amp;= a_1 + \frac{a_2}{2}T + \frac{a_3}{3}T^2
                           + \frac{a_4}{4}T^3 + \frac{a_5}{5}T^4 +
\frac{a_6}{T} \\
\frac{S^{\rm o}}{R}   &amp;= a_1 \ln T + a_2 T + \frac{a_3}{2}T^2 +
\frac{a_4}{3}T^3
                           + \frac{a_5}{4}T^4 + a_7
\end{align}
</span></p></li>
<li><p>The fitting coefficients (<span class="math inline">a_i
(i=1\cdots7)</span>) are tabulated in the database.</p></li>
<li><p>The fits are given over two temperature ranges (high- and
low-temperature ranges? CHECK), and the properties are made smooth at
the interfaces between the two temperature ranges.</p></li>
<li><p>With heat capacities, enthalpies, and entropies in hand, all
other ideal-gas thermodynamics properties follow in the usual ways as
<span class="math display">
\begin{align}
C_v^{\rm o} &amp;= C_p^{\rm o} - R \\
U^{\rm o} &amp;= H^{\rm o} - RT \\
G^{\rm o} &amp;= H^{\rm o} - TS^{\rm o} \\
A^{\rm o} &amp;= U^{\rm o} - TS^{\rm o}
\end{align}
</span> where <span class="math inline">C_v^{\rm o}</span>, <span
class="math inline">U^{\rm o}</span>, <span class="math inline">G^{\rm
o}</span> and <span class="math inline">A^{\rm o}</span> are the molar
constant-volume heat capacity, internal energy, Gibbs free energy, and
Helmholtz energy, respectively.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="transport-properties">Transport properties</h3>
<ul>
<li>Chemically reacting flow must be generally concerned with diffusive
molecular-transport processes. Specifically, properties of particular
interest include dynamics viscosity <span
class="math inline">\mu</span>, thermal conductivity <span
class="math inline">\lambda</span>, and diffusion coefficients <span
class="math inline">D_{ij}</span>.</li>
<li>There is an analytic expression fo the viscosity for dilute
pure-species, based on the <strong>Chapman-Enskog theory</strong>. This
is not covered in this book.</li>
<li>Another approach is using somewhat empirical formula, where fitting
coefficients are used. Gas viscosities are expressed with power law, as
<span class="math display">
\frac{\mu}{\mu_{\rm o}} = \left( \frac{T}{T_{\rm o}} \right)^n
</span> Here viscosity is measured at a reference temperature <span
class="math inline">T_{\rm o}</span>, and the temperature dependence is
given in terms of the exponent <span class="math inline">n</span>. The
value of <span class="math inline">n</span> is expected to be less than
one; for air, <span class="math inline">\mu_{\rm o} = 1.716\times
10^{-5} N s m^{-2}</span> at <span class="math inline">T_{\rm o} = 273
K</span> and <span class="math inline">n \approx 0.67</span>.</li>
<li>The <strong>Sutherland law</strong> is also widely used to express
the temperature dependence of viscosity <span class="math display">
\frac{\mu}{\mu_{\rm o}} = \left( \frac{T}{T_{\rm o}} \right)\frac{T_{\rm
o}+S}{T+S}
</span> The reference viscosity <span class="math inline">\mu_{\rm
o}</span> is measured for a specific gas at reference temperature, and
the parameter <span class="math inline">S</span> is fit over an
appropriate temperature range. For air, using <span
class="math inline">\mu_{\rm o} = 1.716\times 10^{-5} N s m^{-2}</span>
at <span class="math inline">T_{\rm o} = 273 K</span> and <span
class="math inline">S = 111 K</span> provides accurate results over a
large temperature range, <span class="math inline">170 K &lt; T &lt;
1900 K</span>.</li>
<li>Reacting flow inevitably involves mixture of fluids. Thus, mixing
rules are needed to evaluate mixture properties from the
individual-species properties. Mixture viscosity is often evaluated
using the <strong>Wilke formula</strong> as <span class="math display">
\mu_{\rm mix} = \sum_{k=1}^K \frac{X_k\mu_k}{\sum_{j=1}^K X_j \Phi_{kj}}
</span> where <span class="math display">
\Phi_{kj} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{8}}\left(1+\frac{W_k}{W_j}\right)^{-1/2}
          \left[1+\left(\frac{\mu_k}{\mu_j}\right)^{1/2}\left(\frac{W_j}{W_k}\right)^{1/4}\right]^2
</span> In these expressions, <span class="math inline">X_k</span> are
mole fractions, <span class="math inline">\mu_k</span> are the
individual species viscosities, and <span class="math inline">W_k</span>
are the molecular mass.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="diffusion-coefficients">Diffusion coefficients</h3>
<h3 id="thermal-conductivity">Thermal conductivity</h3>
<ul>
<li>The diffusive transport of heat obeys the <strong>Fourier’s
law</strong> as <span class="math display">
{\bf q}&#39;&#39; = –\lambda \nabla T
</span> where <span class="math inline">{\bf q}&#39;&#39;</span>
represents the heat flux (<span class="math inline">W
m^{-2}</span>).</li>
<li>Just as diffusive momentum transfer depends on a transport property
of the fluid called viscosity <span class="math inline">\mu</span>,
diffusive heat transfer depends on a transport property called thermal
conductivity <span class="math inline">\lambda</span>.</li>
<li>Even though there are a number of theories for estimating thermal
conductivities, in practice, empirical curve fits are often used, such
as power law <span class="math display">
\frac{\lambda}{\lambda_{\rm o}} = \left(\frac{T}{T_{\rm o}}\right)^n
</span> , the Sutherland form <span class="math display">
\frac{\lambda}{\lambda_{\rm o}} = \left(\frac{T}{T_{\rm
o}}\right)\frac{T_{\rm o}+S}{T+S}
</span> or some other empirical form. In the Sutherland form, the value
of <span class="math inline">S</span> is established empirically for
each fluid. Assuming that the conductivity <span
class="math inline">\lambda_{\rm o}</span> is known at some reference
temperature <span class="math inline">T_{\rm o}</span>, the conductivity
at other temperature is easily evaluated.</li>
<li>As with viscosity and other properties, the thermal conductivity of
a fluid mixture must be derived in terms of the individual species
conductivities. A commonly used averaging formula is expressed as <span
class="math display">
\lambda_{\rm mix} = \frac{1}{2}\left(
                  \sum_{k=1}^K X_k\lambda_k + \frac{1}{\sum_{k=1}^K
X_k/\lambda_k}
                  \right)
</span> where <span class="math inline">X_k</span> are mole fractions
and <span class="math inline">\lambda_k</span> are individual species
conductivities.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="fluid-kinematics">Fluid kinematics</h2>
<h3 id="system-and-control-volume">System and control volume</h3>
<ul>
<li>The study of fluid mechanics is facilitated by understating and
using the relationship between a <em>system</em> and a <em>control
volume</em>.</li>
<li>By definition, a system is a <em>certain mass of fluid</em>, that
can move about in space. Moreover, the system is free to deform as it
moves. As a result, it is practically impossible to follow and account
for a particular mass of fluid in a flowing process.</li>
<li>Nevertheless, because many of the basic physical laws are written in
terms of a system (e.g. <span class="math inline">{\bf F}=m{\bf
a}</span>), it is convenient and traditional to take advantage of the
notion of a system.</li>
<li>An Eulerian control volume is a fixed region of space. Fluid may
flow through the surfaces of the control volume (the control surfaces),
carrying with it mass, momentum, energy, and chemical species. Equally
important, momentum, energy, and chemical species can “diffuse” across
the control surfaces, into and out of the control volume. There can also
be creating or destruction of thermal energy and chemical species within
a control volume.</li>
<li>In deriving the conservation laws, it is useful to convert between
the system and control-volume views, using both to advantage.</li>
<li>(Lagrangian picture vs. Eulerian picture?)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="extensive-and-intensive-variables---thermodynamics">Extensive
and intensive variables (-&gt; thermodynamics?)</h3>
<ul>
<li>For a system, namely a uniquely identified mass of fluid, it is
often appropriate to think of variables or properties that characterize
the system as a whole.</li>
<li>The total mass, momentum, or energy of the system are called
<em>extensive</em> variables or properties.</li>
<li>It is reasonable to expect that within a system there may be local
spatial variation in variables or properties. The total system property
is determined by integrating local distributions over the mass of the
system. To accomplish the integration, it is useful to define an
<em>intensive</em> variable, which is the extensive variable per unit
mass. That is, if the extensive variable is called <span
class="math inline">N</span>, then the associated intensive variable
<span class="math inline">\eta</span> is defined as <span
class="math display">
\eta = \frac{N}{m}
</span> where <span class="math inline">m</span> is the mass.</li>
<li>For our purposes, it is useful to integrate over a volume that
encompasses the system at an instant of time. In this case, the mass
density <span class="math inline">\rho</span> is used. The extensive
property of a system is thus given as <span class="math display">
N_\text{system} = \int_\text{mass of system}\eta dm = \int_\text{volume
of system}\rho\eta dV
</span></li>
<li>To make this concept concrete, consider a few familiar examples. If
<span class="math inline">N</span> is the mass of a system <span
class="math inline">m</span>, then <span class="math inline">\eta =
1</span>; if <span class="math inline">N</span> is momentum vector <span
class="math inline">{\bf P}</span>, then <span class="math inline">\eta
= {\bf V}</span>, the velocity vector; and if <span
class="math inline">N</span> is energy <span
class="math inline">E</span> (<span class="math inline">J</span>), then
<span class="math inline">\eta = e</span> the specific internal energy
(<span class="math inline">J kg^{-1}</span>).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="reynolds-transport-theorem">Reynolds transport theorem</h3>
<ul>
<li>Consider the system and control volume as illustrated in Fig.X. The
Eulerian control volume is fixed in an inertial reference frame,
described by three independent, orthogonal coordinates, such as <span
class="math inline">x,y,z</span> (Cartesian coordinate) or <span
class="math inline">z, r, \theta</span> (cylindrical coordinate).</li>
<li>At some initial time <span class="math inline">t_0</span>, the
system is defined to contain all the mass in the control volume. A flow
field, described by the velocity vector <span class="math inline">{\bf
V}(t,z,r,\theta)</span>, carries the system’s mass out of the control
volume. In the limit of a vanishingly small time <span
class="math inline">\Delta t</span>, the relationship between the system
and the control volume is know as the <em>Reynolds transport
theorem</em>.</li>
<li>The right-hand panel of Fig.X shows the control volume (dashed
lines) in its original, fixed position, but the system has partially
flowed out of the control volume.</li>
<li>The figure identifies three regions as
<ul>
<li>Region I: the volume of control volume that has been vacated by the
system</li>
<li>Region II: the volume of the control volume that is still occupied
by some of the system mass</li>
<li>Region III: the portion of the system mass that has flowed out of
the control volume</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The right-hand panel also indicates normal outward-pointing unit
vector <span class="math inline">{\bf n}</span> that describe the local
shape of the control surface. Since the control volume retains fixed in
space, the <span class="math inline">{\bf n}</span> vectors also remain
fixed in the reference frame.</li>
<li>The subsequent derivation of partial differential equations that
represent basic conservation laws (e.g. conservation of mass, momentum,
and energy) are structured around a fixed differential control volume,
meaning an <em>Eulerian</em> framework.</li>
<li>The time rate of change of an extensive property <span
class="math inline">N</span> of a system can be written quite generally
as <span class="math display">
\frac{dN}{dt} = \lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0}\frac{N_{t_0+\Delta t} -
N_0}{\Delta t}
</span> where <span class="math inline">N_{t_0}</span> represents the
value of <span class="math inline">N</span> at tome time <span
class="math inline">t_0</span> and <span class="math inline">\Delta
t</span> is some small interval of time. By definition, the system fully
occupies the control volume at <span class="math inline">t_0</span>. In
other words, the system’s and the control volume’s extensive property
are the same at <span class="math inline">t_0</span>. <span
class="math display">
N_{t_0} = N_{CV, t_0}
</span></li>
<li>At <span class="math inline">t_0 + \Delta t</span>, the extensive
property of the <em>system</em> can be written in terms of the three
regions identified in Fig.X as <span class="math display">
\begin{align*}
N_{t_0+\Delta t} = N_{\rm II} + N_{\rm III}
= (N_{CV} - N_{\rm I} + N_{\rm III})_{t_0+\Delta t} \\
= N_{CV,t_0+\Delta t} - N_{{\rm I},t_0+\Delta t} + N_{{\rm
III},t_0+\Delta t}
\end{align*}
</span></li>
<li>Substituting this into Eq.X yields <span class="math display">
\left(\frac{dN}{dt}\right)_{\rm system} = \lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow
0}\frac{N_{CV, t_0+\Delta t} - N_{{\rm I},t_0+\Delta t} + N_{{\rm
III},t_0+\Delta t} - N_{CV, t_0}}{\Delta t}
</span></li>
<li>Recognizing that the limit of a sum can be represented as the sum of
the limits, the above equation can be rearranged as <span
class="math display">
\left(\frac{dN}{dt}\right)_{\rm system} = \lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow
0}\frac{N_{CV, t_0+\Delta t} - N_{CV, t_0}}{\Delta t} + \lim_{\Delta t
\rightarrow 0}\frac{N_{{\rm III}, t_0+\Delta t} - N_{{\rm I},
t_0}}{\Delta t}
</span></li>
<li>Recall from the general relationships between intensive and
extensive variables that an extensive variable is found by integrating
the intensive variable over the mass of a system, or integrating over
the volume of the system. The first term in the above equation can be
rewritten as <span class="math display">
\lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0}\frac{\left[\int_{CV}\rho\eta
dV\right]_{t_0+\Delta t} - \left[\int_{CV}\rho\eta
dV\right]_{t_0}}{\Delta t} = \frac{\partial}{\partial
t}\int_{CV}(\rho\eta) dV
</span> which describes the explicit time variation of the extensive
property of the system.</li>
<li>Consider now the second term on the right-hand side of Eq.X: <span
class="math display">
\lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0}\frac{N_{{\rm III},t_0+\Delta t}-N_{{\rm
I},t_0+\Delta t}}{\Delta t} = \lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow
0}\frac{\left[\int_{\rm III}\rho\eta dV\right]_{t_0+\Delta t} -
\left[\int_{\rm I}\rho\eta dV\right]_{t_0}}{\Delta t}
</span></li>
<li>In the limit of vanishingly small time interval, this term
represents the rate at which the extensive property <span
class="math inline">N</span> is transported convectively with the fluid
motion across the control surface <em>out of</em> the control
volume.</li>
<li>Given that the fluid flow can be described by a velocity vector
field <span class="math inline">{\bf V}</span>, the convective transport
flux across the area <span class="math inline">A</span> of the control
surface can be written <span class="math display">
\lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0}\frac{N_{{\rm III},t_0+\Delta t} - N_{{\rm
I},t_0+\Delta t}}{\Delta t} = \int_{CS}\rho\eta{\bf V}\cdot{\bf n}dA
</span></li>
<li>The expression <span class="math inline">{\bf V}\cdot{\bf
n}dA</span> is the scalar product (dot product) between the velocity
vector and the outward-pointing normal unit vector that describes the
control surface. Since <span class="math inline">{\bf n}</span> is
defined as an <em>outward-normal</em> unit vector, a positive value of
<span class="math inline">\int_{CS}\rho\eta{\bf V}\cdot{\bf n}dA</span>
indicates that <span class="math inline">N</span> leaves the control
volume, while <span class="math inline">N</span> remains in the
<em>system</em>.</li>
<li>Combining Eqs. 3.14, 3.15, and 3.17 yields the <strong>Reynolds
transport theorem</strong>, which relates the time rate of change (net
accumulation) of and extensive property in a flowing system to a fixed
control volume that coincides with the system at an instant in time.
<span class="math display">
\left(\frac{dN}{dt}\right)_{\rm system} =
\int_{CV}\frac{\partial}{\partial t}(\rho\eta)dV + \int_{CS}\rho\eta{\bf
V}\cdot{\bf n}dA
</span></li>
<li>The left-hand side refers to the system, and the right-hand side
refers to the control volume that is initially coincident with the
system. The right-hand side has two terms. The volume integral term is
concerned with the local time rate of change of intensive property
within the control volume. This is the accumulation rate of <span
class="math inline">N</span> within the control volume. The
surface-integral term is concerned with the net rate at which <span
class="math inline">N</span> is carried <em>out of the control
volume</em> by convection with the fluid velocity <span
class="math inline">{\bf V}</span> through the control surface.</li>
<li>It should be recognized that Eq.X is not in itself a conservation
equation, but is the relationship between the system and the control
volume. It may be instructive, however, to anticipate how the
relationship might be used to form a conservation equation. If <span
class="math inline">N</span> represents mass, then <span
class="math inline">dN/dt = 0</span>, since a system, by definition,
contains a fixed amount of mass. In the case where <span
class="math inline">N</span> represents mass, the corresponding
intensive variable is <span class="math inline">\eta = 1</span>. Thus,
Eq.X reduces to <span class="math display">
\int_{CV}\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t}dV = -\int_{CS}\rho{\bf
V}\cdot{\bf n}dA
</span></li>
<li>Physically, this equation states that the rate of accumulation of
mass (represented by density <span class="math inline">\rho</span>)
within the control volume is equal to the net amount of mass that flows
across the control surfaces. The leading negative sign of the right-hand
side accounts for the fact that a positive value of the control-surface
integral indicates flow out of the control volume.</li>
<li>It is possible, and very useful, to write the surface integral in
terms of a volume integral via the Gauss divergence theorem, which
states that <span class="math display">
\int_{CS}a{\bf G}\cdot{\bf n}dA = \int_{CV}(\nabla\cdot a{\bf G})dV =
\int_{CV}(a\nabla\cdot{\bf G})dV
</span> where <span class="math inline">a</span> is a scaler, <span
class="math inline">{\bf G}</span> is a vector, and <span
class="math inline">{\bf n}</span> is the outward-pointing unit vector
at the control surface. The <em>divergence</em> of the vector <span
class="math inline">{\bf G}</span> is represented as <span
class="math inline">\nabla\cdot{\bf G}</span>, which produces a
scalar.</li>
<li>Using the Gauss divergence theorem, the Reynolds transport theorem
(Eq.3.18) can be rewritten as <span class="math display">
\begin{align*}
\left(\frac{dN}{dt}\right)_{\rm system}
&amp;= \int_{CV}\frac{\partial}{\partial t}(\rho\eta)dV +
\int_{CS}\rho\eta{\bf V}\cdot{\bf n}dA \\
&amp;= \int_{CV}\left(\frac{\partial (\rho\eta)}{\partial t} +
\nabla\cdot\rho\eta{\bf V}\right)
\end{align*}
</span></li>
<li>If the control volume is a vanishingly small one, meaning a
differential control volume, then the integrand in Eq.3.21 can be viewed
as being constant within the volume. Hence, carrying out the integral is
rather simple, yielding <span class="math display">
\left(\frac{dN}{dt}\right)_{\rm system} =
\left(\frac{\partial(\rho\eta)}{\partial t} + \nabla\cdot\rho\eta{\bf
V}\right)\delta V
</span> where <span class="math inline">\delta V</span> is the volume of
the differential control volume. For example, a Cartesian differential
control volume as a volume <span class="math inline">\delta V =
dxdydz</span>. In a series of manipulations that follow, the terms
withing the parentheses are defined as a differential operator called
the <strong>substantial derivative</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="substantial-derivative">Substantial derivative</h3>
<ul>
<li>Although it will be derived in the later chapter, let us assume the
mass-conservation equation <span class="math display">
\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla\cdot(\rho{\bf V}) = 0
</span> holds. When the right-hand side of Eq.22 is expanded as <span
class="math display">
\left(\frac{dN}{dt}\right)_{\rm system} = \left[\rho\frac{\partial
\eta}{\partial t} + \eta\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \rho{\bf
V}\cdot\nabla \eta + \eta\nabla\cdot\rho{\bf V}\right]\delta V
</span> it is apparent that the mass-continuity equation eliminates two
terms exactly.</li>
<li>The resulting expression represents the substantial derivative,
which is defined as <span class="math display">
\frac{D\eta}{Dt} \equiv \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial t} + {\bf
V}\cdot\nabla\eta
</span></li>
<li>The fundamental relationship between a flowing system and an
Eulerian control volume, which are coincident at an instant in time, is
stated as <span class="math display">
\left(\frac{dN}{dt}\right)_{\rm system} =
\left[\rho\frac{D\eta}{Dt}\right]_{CV}\delta V
</span></li>
<li>This equation provides the relationship between the rate of the
change of an extensive property <span class="math inline">N</span> for a
system and the substantial derivative of the associated intensive
variable <span class="math inline">\eta</span> in an Eulerian control
volume <span class="math inline">\delta V</span> that is fixed in
space.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conservation-equations">Conservation equations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Overall the objective of this chapter is to cast the conservation
equations in the form of partial differential equations (PDEs) in an
Eulerian framework with the independent variable being time and the
spatial coordinates. The approach combines the notions of conservation
laws for systems with the behavior of control volumes fixed in space,
through which fluid flows.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="mass-continuity">Mass continuity</h3>
<ul>
<li>Regardless of what other conservation equations may be appropriate,
a bulk-fluid mass-conservation equation is invariably required in
representing any fluid-flow situation.</li>
<li>Under most circumstances, mass cannot be created or destroyed within
a control volume. Chemical reaction, for example, may produce or consume
individual species, but overall no mass is created or destroyed.
Furthermore, the only way that net mass can be transported across the
control surface is by convection. While individual species may diffuse
across the control surfaces by molecular actions, there can be no net
mass transport by molecular diffusion.</li>
<li>It may be noted that there may be circumstances in two-phase flow
where for a given phase there are source or sink terms in describing
mass conservation. The conservation of liquid to vapor (and vice versa)
causes source terms, namely the creation (or destruction) of mass within
a phase. Of course, there must be overall mass conservation between the
phases, with not net creation of destruction of mass.</li>
<li>The mass-continuity equation, actually which was already used in the
derivation of the substantial-derivative, is <span class="math display">
\left(\frac{dm}{dt}\right)_{\rm system}
= \int_{CV}\left(\frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t} + \nabla\cdot\rho{\bf
V}\right)dV = 0
</span></li>
<li>Assuming a vanishingly small differential control volume, the
integrand can be assumed to be uniform over the volume. Then the
integrand in the above equation is <span class="math display">
\begin{align*}
\int_{CV}\left(\frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t} + \nabla\cdot\rho{\bf
V}\right)dV
&amp;=\left(\frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t} + \nabla\cdot{\bf V}\right)
\int_{CV}dV \\
&amp;=\left(\frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t} + \nabla\cdot{\bf
V}\right)\delta V = 0
\end{align*}
</span></li>
<li>Consequently, the continuity equation can be written in
differential-equation form as <span class="math display">
\frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t} + \nabla\cdot\rho{\bf V} = 0
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="navier-stokes-equations">Navier-Stokes equations</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Navier-Stokes equations express the conservation of momentum.
Together with the continuity equation, which expresses the conservation
of mass, these equations are th fundamental underpinning of fluid
mechanism.</li>
<li>They are nonlinear partial differential equations that in general
cannot be solved by analytical means. Although the Navier-Stokes
equations defy general analytic solution, solution by numerical methods
has become commonplace as a practical engineering analysis and design
tool.</li>
<li>The principle of momentum conservation for a system can be written
generally as <span class="math display">
\frac{d{\bf P}}{dt} = \sum{\bf F}
</span> where the rate of change of momentum <span
class="math inline">{\bf P}</span> is caused by the forces <span
class="math inline">{\bf F}</span> acting on the system. For a solid
body, momentum conservation is usually written as the familiar equation
(Newton’s second law) <span class="math display">
{\bf F} = m{\bf a}
</span> where <span class="math inline">{\bf F}</span> is the vector of
forces acting on the mass <span class="math inline">m</span> and <span
class="math inline">{\bf a}</span> is the mass’ acceleration vector. The
acceleration of a solid body can be simply expressed as <span
class="math display">
{\bf a} = \frac{d {\bf V}}{dt}
</span> where <span class="math inline">{\bf V}</span> is the
solid-body’s velocity vector.</li>
<li>For a fluid flow, the RTT establishes the relation between an system
(where the momentum balance applies directly) and an Eulerian control
volume (through which fluid flows).</li>
<li>Here, the extensive variable <span class="math inline">N</span> is
the momentum vector <span class="math inline">{\bf P} = m{\bf V}</span>
and the intensive variable <span class="math inline">\eta</span> is the
velocity vector <span class="math inline">{\bf V}</span>. Thus,
application of the RTT yields the following vector equation: <span
class="math display">
\left[\rho\frac{D{\bf V}}{Dt}\right]\delta V = \frac{d{\bf P}}{dt}
= \sum{\bf F} = \sum{\bf F}_{\rm body} + \sum{\bf F}_{\rm surface}
</span> where <span class="math inline">D{\bf V}/Dt</span> is the
substantial derivative and <span class="math inline">\delta V</span> is
the volume of a differential control volume.</li>
<li>It is useful to think of two different kinds of forces, one that
acts over the volume of a fluid element and the other that acts on the
elements’ surface. The most common body force is exerted by the effect
of gravity. <span class="math display">
{\bf F}_{\rm body} = m{\bf g}
</span></li>
<li>For a differential control volume, it is convenient to divide Eq.X
by the volume of the control volume <span class="math inline">\delta
V</span>. This leads to a general differential-equation statement of the
Navier-Stokes equations as <span class="math display">
\rho\frac{D{\bf V}}{Dt}
= {\bf f}_{\rm body} + {\bf f}_{\rm surface}
= \rho{\bf g} + \nabla\cdot{\textsf T} = \rho{\bf g} - \nabla p +
\nabla\cdot{\textsf T}&#39;
</span> where <span class="math inline">{\bf f}</span> is the force per
unit volume (<span class="math inline">N m^{-3}</span>), which is also
the momentum-flux vector. The surface forces are determined from the
stress tensor. The pressure-gradient term can be separated from the
general stress term by using the deviatoric stress tensor.</li>
<li>The gravitational body-force term becomes <span
class="math display">
{\bf f}_{\rm body} = \rho{\bf g}
</span></li>
<li>In the case of a constant-viscosity fluid, the Navier-Stokes
equations can be significantly simplified as following general vector
form, <span class="math display">
\begin{align*}
\rho\frac{D{\bf V}}{Dt}
&amp;= \rho\left[\frac{\partial {\bf V}}{\partial t} + ({\bf
V}\cdot\nabla){\bf V}\right] \\
&amp;= \rho\left[\frac{\partial {\bf V}}{\partial t} +
\nabla\left(\frac{{\bf V}\cdot{\bf V}}{2}\right)-{\bf
V}\times(\nabla\times{\bf V})\right] \\
&amp;= {\bf f} - \nabla p - \mu\nabla\times(\nabla\times{\bf V}) +
(\kappa+2\mu)\nabla(\nabla\cdot{\bf V}) \\
&amp;= {\bf f} - \nabla p + \mu\nabla^2{\bf V} +
(\kappa+\mu)\nabla(\nabla\cdot{\bf V})
\end{align*}
</span> A vector identity defined the Laplacian of a vector as <span
class="math display">
\begin{align*}
\nabla^2{\bf V} &amp;\equiv \nabla(\nabla\cdot{\bf V}) -
\nabla\times(\nabla\times{\bf V}) \\
              &amp;= \nabla(\nabla\cdot{\bf V}) - \nabla\times\omega
\end{align*}
</span> These general vector operations can be expanded into any
particular coordinate system of interest. In this form, the vorticity
<span class="math inline">\omega \equiv \nabla\times{\bf V}</span>
appears explicitly. Also recall that for incompressible flows <span
class="math inline">\nabla\cdot{\bf V}</span> vanishes, thus eliminating
the final term.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="species-diffusion">Species diffusion</h3>
<ul>
<li>To derive the species-continuity equations that follow, it is
important to establish some relationships between mass fluxes and
species concentration fields.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="mass-and-mole-measure">Mass and mole measure</h4>
<ul>
<li>Working with multicomponent mixtures requires quantifying the
amounts of various chemical constituents that comprise the mixture. In
the conservation equations the mass fraction is the most appropriate
measure, since mass is a conserved quantity. By definition, the mass
fraction is <span class="math display">
Y_k \equiv \frac{\rho_k}{\rho}
</span> where <span class="math inline">\rho_k</span> is the mass
density of the k-th species and <span class="math inline">\rho</span> is
the total density. Clearly, <span class="math display">
\sum_{k=1}^K\rho_k = \rho, \ \ \sum_{k=1}^K Y_k = 1
</span></li>
<li>Chemical behaviors, such as chemical reactions, are usually best
quantified on a molar basis. That is, a certain number of moles of one
species reacts with a certain number of moles of another to produce a
certain amount of product species. Here a mole fraction, not a mass
fraction, is the most appropriate measure of the mixture composition.
The mole fraction <span class="math inline">X_k</span> is the number of
moles of species <span class="math inline">k</span> in a volume divided
by the total moles in the volume. For an ideal gas, the mole fraction is
related to mass fraction as <span class="math display">
X_k = Y_k\frac{\bar{W}}{W_k}
</span> where <span class="math inline">W_k</span> is the molecular mass
of species <span class="math inline">k</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\bar{W}</span> is the average molecular mass defined
by <span class="math inline">\bar{W} = \sum_{k=1}^K X_k W_k</span>.</li>
<li>The molar concentration <span class="math inline">[X_k]</span> is
the measure of chemical composition that is most natural for the
description of chemical reaction. The molar concentration of an ideal
gas can be written as <span class="math display">
[X_k] = \frac{p}{RT}X_k = [X_k]_{\rm tot}X_k
</span> where <span class="math inline">p/RT = [X_k]_{\rm tot}</span> is
the total concentration of a gas mixture. The concentration is measured
as moles per unit volume (<span class="math inline">mol
m^{-3}</span>).</li>
<li>The partial pressure of a species <span
class="math inline">p_k</span> in an ideal-gas mixture is closely
related to the mole fraction; <span class="math display">
\sum_{k=1}^K\frac{p_k}{p} = \sum_{k=1}^K X_k = 1
</span> Thus the mass fraction of <span class="math inline">k</span>-th
species <span class="math inline">Y_k</span> can be calculated from
<span class="math inline">p_k</span> as <span class="math display">
Y_k = \frac{p_k}{p}\frac{W_k}{\bar{W}}
</span></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="diffusive-mass-flux">Diffusive mass flux</h4>
<ul>
<li>Whenever there are chemical-composition variations in a fluid, there
is a tendency for chemical species to be transported by molecular
diffusion from regions of higher concentration to regions of lower
concentration.</li>
<li>In the simplest theory, Fick’s law, the diffusive mass flux of a
species depends linearly on the negative concentration gradient of the
species concentration with a proportionality constant called a diffusion
coefficient. The negative sign sets the direction of the flux toward the
low-concentration region.</li>
<li>The diffusive mass-flux vector (<span class="math inline">kg m^{-2}
s^{-1}</span>) can be represented as <span class="math display">
{\bf j}_k = \rho Y_k {\bf V}_k
</span> where <span class="math inline">{\bf V}_k</span> is the
<em>diffusion-velocity</em> vector for the k-the species.</li>
<li>As represented by <strong>Fick’s law</strong>, <span
class="math display">
{\bf V}_k = -\frac{1}{X_k}D_{km}&#39; \nabla X_k
</span> where <span class="math inline">D_{km}&#39;</span> represents a
“mixture-averaged” diffusion coefficient for species <span
class="math inline">k</span> relative to the rest of the multicomponent
mixture. The mixture-averaged diffusion coefficient can be evaluated in
terms of the *binary diffusion coefficient <span
class="math inline">{\mathcal D}_{jk}</span> as <span
class="math display">
D_{km}&#39; = \frac{1-Y_k}{\sum_{j \ne k}X_j/D_{jk}}
</span></li>
<li>The species mass-flux vectors can be written in terms of the
mole-fraction gradient as <span class="math display">
{\bf j}_k = -\rho\frac{Y_k}{X_k}D_{km}&#39;\nabla X_k =
–\rho\frac{W_k}{\bar{W}}D_{km}&#39;\nabla X_k
</span></li>
<li>It is important to realize that there cannot be a net transport of
mass by diffusive action within a homogeneous multicomponent field. The
transport of some species in one direction must be balanced by transport
of other species in the other direction. <span class="math display">
\sum_{k=1}^K {\bf j}_k\cdot{\bf n}dA = \sum_{k=1}^K\rho Y_k{\bf
V}_k\cdot{\bf n}dA = 0
</span> Here <span class="math inline">{\bf n}dA</span> is some
differential area, with ints spatial orientation specified by an
outward-normal unit vector <span class="math inline">{\bf n}</span>.
Since the equation is true for any differential area, it is generally
true that <span class="math display">
\sum_{k=1}^K {\bf j}_k = 0
</span></li>
<li>The discussion to this point in the section has considered only
diffusive mass transport. It should be noted that the net mass transport
of a species <span class="math inline">k</span> crossing a certain area
<span class="math inline">dA</span> is the sum of diffusive and
convective contributions. This is stated as <span class="math display">
\dot{m}_k = \rho Y_k({\bf V}+{\bf V}_k)\cdot{\bf n}dA
</span> where <span class="math inline">{\bf V}</span> is the bulk fluid
velocity.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="stefan-maxwell-equations">Stefan-Maxwell equations</h4>
<ul>
<li>The evaluation of the diffusion velocities requires the evaluation
of the multi-component diffusion coefficients from the binary diffusion
coefficients.</li>
<li>In <strong>Stefan-Maxwell equations</strong>, the diffusion
velocities are related <em>implicitly</em> to the temperature, pressure,
and mole-fraction gradients as <span class="math display">
\begin{align*}
\nabla X_k = \sum_{j=1}^K\frac{X_K X_J}{{\mathcal D}_{kj}} ({\bf V}_j -
{\bf V}_k) + (Y_k-X_k)\frac{\nabla p}{p} \\
                     + \sum_{j=1}^K\frac{X_k X_j}{\rho{\mathcal D}_{kj}}
\left(\frac{D_j^T}{Y_j} - \frac{D_k^T}{Y_k} \right) \frac{\nabla T}{T}
\end{align*}
</span> Note that the Stefan-Maxwell equations involve the <em>binary
diffusion coefficients</em> <span class="math inline">{\mathcal
D}_{kj}</span>, and not hte ordinary multi-component diffusion
coefficients <span class="math inline">D_{jk}</span>.</li>
<li>In the mixture-averaged formalism, the ordinary multicomponent
diffusion coefficient must be evaluated from the binary diffusion
coefficients. This requires the matrix inversion, which can add
computational complexity. The Stefan-Maxwell formulation uses the binary
diffusion coefficient directly, but requires the solution of the linear
system to evaluate the diffusion velocities. At each point in a flow
field, one could solve the system of equations (Eq.X, above) to
determine the diffusion-velocity vector.</li>

<li>Begin with the system law, stated as <span class="math display">
\left(\frac{d m_k}{dt}\right)_{\rm system}
= -\int_{CS}{\bf j}_k\cdot{\bf n}dA + \int_{CV}\dot{\omega}_k W_k dV
</span> In other words, the rate of change of the mass of species <span
class="math inline">k</span> in the system is balanced by the rate at
which the <span class="math inline">k</span>-th species diffuses across
the control surfaces and the rate at which the <span
class="math inline">k</span>-th species is created or consumed by
chemical reaction.</li>
<li>The species mass <span class="math inline">m_k</span> is the
extensive variable and the associated intensive variable is the mass
fraction <span class="math inline">Y_k</span>. Based on the RTT, the
convective flus of the <span class="math inline">k</span>-th species is
accommodated by the substantial derivative. Thus, exchanging the system
view for the control-volume view, <span class="math display">
\left[\rho\frac{DY_k}{Dt}\right]\delta V = -\int_{CS}{\bf j}_k\cdot{\bf
n}dA + \int_{CV}\dot{\omega}_k W_k dV
</span></li>
<li>The first term on the right-hand side describes the net species mass
flux that diffuses into the system. The lead minus sign is required to
accommodate the fact that <span class="math inline">{\bf n}</span> is
defined as an <em>outward-normal</em> unit vector. The second term
represents the production/consumption of the <span
class="math inline">k</span>-th species by chemical reaction.</li>
<li>The surface integral can be converted to a volume integral using the
Gauss divergence theorem, yielding <span class="math display">
\left[\rho\frac{DY_k}{Dt}\right]\delta V = \int_{CV}(-\nabla\cdot{\bf
j}_k + \dot{\omega}_k W_k)dV
</span></li>
<li>For a vanishingly small differential control volume, the integrand
can be considered constant. Thus, the integration yields <span
class="math display">
\int_{CV}(-\nabla\cdot{\bf j}_k+\dot{\omega}_k W_k)dV =
(-\nabla\cdot{\bf j}_k+\dot{\omega}_k W_k)\delta V
</span> where <span class="math inline">\delta V</span> is the volume of
the differential control volume. After dividing each term by <span
class="math inline">\delta V</span>, a partial differential equation
(the <strong>species-continuity equation</strong>) emerges as <span
class="math display">
\rho\frac{DY_k}{Dt} = -\nabla\cdot{\bf j}_k + \dot{\omega}_k W_k
</span></li>
<li>The variable <span class="math inline">\dot{\omega}_k</span> is used
to denote the volumetric molar production/destruction rate of species
<span class="math inline">k</span> by chemical reaction (<span
class="math inline">mol m^{-3} s^{-1}</span>). A great many reactions
may participate in the production of <span
class="math inline">k</span>-th species that comprise the multicomponent
mixture. While the molar production/destruction rate is natural from the
chemical reaction formalism, the mass rate of change is more natural
choice in the species mass balance. In this case, <span
class="math inline">\dot{\omega_k}W_k</span> represents the mass rate of
change (<span class="math inline">kg m^{-3} s^{-1}</span>), where <span
class="math inline">W_k</span> is the molar mass of species <span
class="math inline">k</span>. Chemical reaction converts some species to
other species; hence the mass represented by individual species changes
via chemical reaction. However, a homogeneous chemical reaction cannot
create or destroy net mass. Therefore, in a homogeneous mixture <span
class="math display">
\sum_{k=1}^K \dot{\omega}_k W_k = 0
</span></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="summation-of-species-continuity">Summation of species
continuity</h4>
<ul>
<li>By expanding the substantial derivative of Eq.X, the
species-continuity equation can be written as <span
class="math display">
\int_{CV}\left(\frac{\partial(\rho Y_k)}{\partial t} + \nabla\cdot\rho
Y_k {\bf V}\right)dV = \int_{CV}(-\nabla\cdot{\bf j}_k + \dot{\omega}_k
W_k)dV
</span> Integrating over the differential control volume and dividing by
the differential volume yields the species-continuity equation in
differential-equation form as <span class="math display">
\frac{\partial(\rho Y_k)}{\partial t} + \nabla\cdot\rho Y_k {\bf V} =
-\nabla\cdot{\bf j}_k + \dot{\omega}_k W_k
</span> Summing over all species yields <span class="math display">
\begin{align*}
\sum_{k=1}^K \left(\frac{\partial(\rho Y_k)}{\partial t} +
\nabla\cdot\rho Y_k {\bf V} \right)
&amp;= \sum_{k=1}^K(-\nabla\cdot{\bf j}_k + \dot{\omega}_k W_k) \\
\frac{\partial\rho \sum_{k=1}^K Y_k}{\partial t} +
\nabla\cdot\rho\sum_{k=1}^K Y_k {\bf V} &amp;=
-\nabla\cdot\sum_{k=1}^K{\bf j}_k + \sum_{k=1}^K\dot{\omega}_k W_k
\end{align*}
</span> As discussed earlier (Eqs.X and X), both therms on the
right-hand side are zero. Also, since <span
class="math inline">\sum_{k=1}^K Y_k = 1</span>, the overall
mass-continuity equation is recovered. <span class="math display">
\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla\cdot\rho{\bf V} = 0
</span> It may also be noted that summing the system representation must
also produce the starting point for derivation of the overall
mass-continuity equation, <span class="math display">
\sum_{k=1}^K\frac{dm_k}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt}\sum_{k=1}^K m_k =
\frac{dm}{dt} = 0
</span> In other words, by definition, the net mass in a system cannot
change.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conservation-of-energy">Conservation of energy</h3>
<ul>
<li>Derivation of the energy equation begins with the first law of
thermodynamics, which includes both thermal and mechanical energy. In
fluid mechanics, however, the primary interest is in the thermal energy,
which is represented by enthalpy or temperature fields. By subtracting
the mechanical-energy components from the total energy equation, it is
possible to derive a <em>thermal-energy equation</em> that serves as the
basis for the most subsequent analysis.</li>
<li>One important purpose of the energy equation is to describe and
predict the fluid temperature fields. The energy equation must be
closely coupled to the continuity and Navier-Stokes equations, which
describe the velocity fields.</li>
<li>The coupling comes through the convective terms in the substantial
derivative, which, of course, involve the velocities.</li>
<li>The Navier-Stokes equations are also coupled to the energy equation,
since the density and other properties usually depend on
temperature.</li>
<li>Chemical reaction and molecular transport of chemical species can
also have a major influence on the thermal energy of a flow.</li>
<li>The energy equation is a statement of the first law of
thermodynamics, just as the Navier-Stokes equations are statements of
the Netwon’s second law, <span class="math inline">{\bf F} = m{\bf
a}</span>.</li>
<li>For a <span class="math inline">system</span>, the first law states
that the rate of the total energy change equals the rate of heat
transferred to the system plus the rate of work done on the system. That
is, <span class="math display">
\frac{dE_t}{dt} = \frac{dQ}{dt} + \frac{dW}{dt}
</span> where <span class="math inline">E_t</span> is the extensive
variable that represents the total energy stored in a system (<span
class="math inline">J</span>). <span class="math inline">Q</span>
represents heat added <em>to</em> the system, and <span
class="math inline">W</span> represents work done <em>on</em> the
system. The total energy includes internal, kinetic, and potential
energy <span class="math display">
\frac{E_t}{m} = e_t = \left(e + \frac{1}{2}({\bf V}\cdot{\bf V}) - {\bf
g}\cdot{\bf r}\right)
</span></li>
<li>The intensive variable is the total specific energy <span
class="math inline">e_t</span>, where <span class="math inline">m</span>
is the mass of the system (<span class="math inline">kg</span>). There
are three contributions to the total energy; the specific internal
energy <span class="math inline">e</span> has contributions that
represent the random motion of molecules associated with non-zero
temperature. It also has contributions that represent the potential
energy associated with chemical bonds. The second term represents
directed kinetic energy of the fluid. The third term represents the
potential energy associated with the downward-directed acceleration of
gravity <span class="math inline">{\bf g}</span>, and <span
class="math inline">{\bf r}</span> is the displacement of a fluid packet
relative to some reference.</li>
<li>Recalling the general relationship between a system and a control
volume, the left-hand side of the energy balance can be written as <span
class="math display">
\left(\frac{dE_t}{dt}\right)_{\rm system} = \left[\rho\frac{\partial
e_t}{\partial t} + \rho{\bf V}\cdot\nabla e_t \right]_{CV}\delta V =
\left[\rho\frac{De_t}{Dt}\right]_{CV}\delta V
</span></li>
<li>This equation represents the rate of change of the system’s total
energy in terms of hte substantial derivative for a flowing system
applied to an Eulerian control volume fixed in space.</li>
<li>Differentiating the definition of total energy yields an expression
for the substantial derivative of the total energy as <span
class="math display">
\frac{De_t}{Dt} = \left(\frac{De}{Dt} + {\bf V}\cdot\frac{D{\bf V}}{Dt}
- {\bf g}\cdot{\bf V}\right)
</span></li>
<li>The time derivative of the displacement vector <span
class="math inline">{\bf r}</span> is the velocity <span
class="math inline">{\bf V}</span>, which assumes that the fluid system
is moving with the fluid velocity.</li>
<li>The left-hand side of the energy equation now represents the
convective transport, and it remains to develop the heat-transfer and
work terms on the right-hand side <span class="math display">
\rho\left(\frac{De}{Dt}+{\bf V}\cdot\frac{D{\bf V}}{Dt}-{\bf V}\cdot{\bf
V}\right)\delta V = \frac{dQ}{dt}+\frac{dW}{dt}
</span></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="heat-transfer-rate">Heat-transfer rate</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>The next task is to develop expressions for the heat-transfer and
work terms in Eq.X. Consider two contributions to the heat transfer
crosses the surfaces of a control volume.</p></li>
<li><p>The first is thermal conduction via the Fourier’s law, which
behaves in the same way for a fluid as it does for a solid. The second
contribution is associated with energy that crosses the control surfaces
as chemical species diffuse into and out of the control volume.</p></li>
<li><p>Chemical reaction is often thought to provide a “source of heat”
or “heat release” in the control volume.</p></li>
<li><p>Importantly, this contribution is <em>not</em> and internal heat
source but rather represents a change in the internal energy by the
breaking and forming of chemical bonds.</p></li>
<li><p>Although the temperature may change due to chemical reactions,
the total energy of the system does not change as a result.</p></li>
<li><p>The Fourier’s law states that <em>heat flux</em> (<span
class="math inline">W m^{-2} or J s^{-1}m^{-2}</span>) is proportional
to the negative temperature gradient, with the constant of
proportionality being the thermal conductivity <span
class="math inline">\lambda</span>, <span class="math display">
{\bf q} = -\lambda \nabla T
</span></p></li>
<li><p>Clearly, the heat flux is a vector whose direction is defined by
the temperature gradient. The net heat <span
class="math inline">dQ/dt</span> (<span class="math inline">W or J
s^{-1}</span>) that crosses a control surface into the volume by thermal
conduction is given by <span class="math display">
\left(\frac{dQ}{dt}\right)_{\rm conduction} = -\int_{CS}{\bf q}\cdot{\bf
n}dA = \int_{CS}\lambda\nabla T\cdot{\bf n}dA
</span> where <span class="math inline">{\bf n}</span> is an
outward-normal-pointing unit vector. When heat flows into the control
volume, <span class="math inline">dQ/dt</span> is positive. Thus, the
negative sign is needed because, when <span class="math inline">{\bf
q}</span> flows into the control volume, its direction is opposite to
<span class="math inline">{\bf n}</span>, which points outward.
Consequently, with the minus sign in front of the integral, <span
class="math inline">dQ/dt</span> is positive when <span
class="math inline">{\bf q}</span> is the opposite direction of <span
class="math inline">{\bf n}</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Turn now to the heat transfer associated with the species mass
fluxes that diffuse across the control surfaces, which is stated as
<span class="math display">
\left(\frac{dQ}{dt}\right)_{\rm species} = -\sum_{k=1}^K\int_{CS}h_k{\bf
j}_k\cdot{\bf n}dA
</span> where <span class="math inline">h_k</span> is the enthalpy of
species <span class="math inline">k</span>. Each species carries with
its energy as it diffuses across the control surface. The minus sign is
needed, as it was for the thermal conduction, because when <span
class="math inline">{\bf n}</span> and <span class="math inline">{\bf
j}_k</span> have opposite directions, energy enters the control volume
resulting in positive <span class="math inline">dQ/dt</span>. The fact
that enthalpy <span class="math inline">h_k</span>, rather than internal
energy <span class="math inline">e_k</span>, represents the energy
content is because “flow work” also contributes to the energy exchange.
Using the definition of enthalpy <span class="math inline">h_k = e_k +
p_k / \rho_k</span>, and substituting for the mass flux <span
class="math inline">{\bf j}_k = \rho_k{\bf V}_k = \rho Y_k{\bf
V}_k</span>, the above equation can be rewritten as <span
class="math display">
\left(\frac{dQ}{dt}\right)_{\rm species} =
-\sum_{k=1}^K\int_{CS}\left(e_k+\frac{p_k}{\rho_k}\right)\rho_k{\bf
V}_k\cdot{\bf n}dA
</span> and then <span class="math display">
\left(\frac{dQ}{dt}\right)_{\rm species} =
-\sum_{k=1}^K\left(\int_{CS}e_k\rho_k{\bf V}_k\cdot{\bf n}dA +
\int_{CS}p_k{\bf V}_k\cdot{\bf n}dA \right)
</span></p></li>
<li><p>The first term on the right-and side represents the internal
energy that is carried across the control surface with the diffusion
velocity. The second term represents the “<span
class="math inline">pV</span>” work caused by the force exerted at the
control surface by the pressure as it acts on the fluid that is moving
with the diffusion velocity. While this type of flow work could be
grouped with the <span class="math inline">dW/dt</span> term, it is a
long-standing convention to group it with <span
class="math inline">dQ/dt</span> using the enthalpy as the energy
measure.</p></li>
<li><p>The net heat-transfer rate is the sum of two contributions, <span
class="math display">
\begin{align*}
\frac{dQ}{dt} &amp;= \left(\frac{dQ}{dt}\right)_{\rm conduction} +
\left(\frac{dQ}{dt}\right)_{\rm species} \\
            &amp;= \int_{CS}\lambda\nabla T\cdot{\bf n}dA -
\sum_{k=1}^K\int_{CS}h_k{\bf j}_k\cdot{\bf n}dA
\end{align*}
</span></p></li>
<li><p>Using the Gauss divergence theorem, the surface integrals can be
rewritten as a volume integrals, yielding <span class="math display">
\frac{dQ}{dt} = \int_{CV}(\nabla\cdot\lambda\nabla T)dV -
\sum_{k=1}^K\int_{CV}\nabla\cdot h_k{\bf j}_k dV
</span></p></li>
<li><p>Assuming a vanishingly small control volume, so that there is no
variation of the integrands within the control volume, the integrals are
easily accomplished as <span class="math display">
\frac{dQ}{dt} = \left( \nabla\cdot\lambda\nabla T -
\sum_{k=1}^K\nabla\cdot h_k{\bf j}_k \right)\delta V
</span> where <span class="math inline">\delta V</span> is the volume of
a differential control volume.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="rate-of-work">Rate of work</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Turn now to the work term <span class="math inline">dW/dt</span>.
The stress tensor causes forces on the surfaces of a control volume,
through which fluid is moving, with the result being work.</p></li>
<li><p>On any arbitrary surface <span class="math inline">dA</span>, the
resultant stress can be represented as a vector <span

<li><p>The velocity at the surface is represented as a vector <span
class="math inline">{\bf V}</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>At any point in the flow field, the stress state is represented
by a second-order tensor <span class="math inline">{\textsf

<li><p>On a surface, which may represent some portion of the control
surface that bounds a control volume, the stress is represented as a
vector.</p></li>
<li><p>The relationship between the stress tensor <span
class="math inline">{\textsf T}</span> at a point and the stress vector
<span class="math inline">\tau</span> on a particular surface that
passes through the point is given as (Eq.3.113) <span
class="math display">
\tau = {\bf n}\cdot{\textsf T}
</span> where <span class="math inline">{\bf n}</span> is the
outward-directed unit vector of the surface <span
class="math inline">dA</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>In general, the rate of work done at some surface moving with
velocity <span class="math inline">{\bf V}</span> is <span
class="math display">
</span></p></li>
<li><p>Here, <span class="math inline">\tau</span> is the stress
<em>vector</em>. Note that both normal stress and shear stress
contribute ot work. That is, work is associated with both dilation and
deformation.</p></li>
<li><p>Now let us convert the surface integral to a volume integral,
using the Gauss theorem. However, the work-rate integral does not appear
to be in a form directly suitable for the divergence theorem, since it
does not involve the scalar product of a vector with the normal
component of the area. Therefore some operations are needed.</p></li>
<li><p>First, recognize the associative property of the scalar product
of the two vectors: <span class="math display">
\tau\cdot{\bf V} = {\bf V}\cdot\tau
</span></p></li>
<li><p>Then, an identity permits the following less-than-obvious step:
<span class="math display">
{\bf V}\cdot({\bf n}\cdot{\textsf T}) = {\bf n}\cdot({\bf
V}\cdot{\textsf T}^T)
</span></p></li>
<li><p>Here, <span class="math inline">{\textsf T}^T</span> is the
transpose of the stress tensor. Since the stress tensor is symmetric,
the transpose and the original tensor are identical. Thus <span
class="math display">
\frac{dW}{dt} = \int_{CS}{\bf n}\cdot({\bf V}\cdot{\textsf T})dA =
\int_{CS}({\bf V}\cdot{\textsf T})\cdot{\bf n}dA
</span></p></li>
<li><p>Now we have <span class="math inline">{\bf n}dA</span> term thus
the Gauss theorem can be used, as <span class="math display">
\int_{CS}({\bf V}\cdot{\textsf T})\cdot{\bf n} dA =
\int_{CV}\nabla\cdot({\bf V}\cdot{\textsf T})dV
</span></p></li>
<li><p>The rate of work done on a differential control volume <span

expressed as <span class="math display">
\frac{dW}{dt} = \nabla\cdot({\bf V}\cdot{\textsf T})\delta V
</span></p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="total-energy-equation-in-vector-form">Total energy equation in

<li>With all the individual terms in hand, the full energy equation can
be assembled and represented in compact vector form as <span

</span></li>
<li>In fluid mechanics, it is unusual to formulate problems in the
context of the total energy equation; rather, the <em>thermal-energy
equation</em> is more practically useful. The thermal-energy equation is
formed by subtracting the <em>mechanical-energy equation</em> from the
total energy equation.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="mechanical-energy">Mechanical energy</h3>
<ul>
<li>The mechanical-energy equation is formed by the scalar product of
the velocity vector and the momentum equations (Navier-Stokes
equations).</li>
<li>By a vector-tensor identity for symmetric tensors, the work-rate
term <span class="math inline">dW/dt</span> can be expanded as <span

</span> The dyadic product (<span class="math inline">:</span>) of the
stress tensor and the velocity-gradient tensor produces a scalar. Note
that the work is a scalar quantity.</li>
<li>The first term on the right-hand side of the above equation includes
the divergence of the stress tensor, which also appears in the vector
form of the momentum equations (Navier-Stokes equations). The momentum
equation can be easily rearranged as <span class="math display">
\nabla\cdot{\textsf T} = \rho\left(\frac{D{\bf V}}{Dt} - {\bf g}\right)
</span> It then follows that the first term in Eq.X can be written as
<span class="math display">
{\bf V}\cdot(\nabla\cdot{\textsf T}) = \rho\left({\bf V}\cdot\frac{D{\bf

</span> This equation describes the conservation of <em>mechanical
energy</em>.</li>
<li>It is apparent that all the terms in the above also appear directly
on the left-hand side of the total energy equation (Eq.4.148).
Therefore, subtraction is done by removing the mechanical-energy
contribution from the total energy equation.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="thermal-energy">Thermal energy</h3>
<ul>
<li>In the general vector form, the thermal-energy equation may be
stated as <span class="math display">
\rho\frac{De}{Dt} = - \nabla\cdot{\bf q} - \sum_{k=1}^K\nabla\cdot
h_k{\bf j}_k + {\textsf T}:\nabla{\bf V}
</span> where <span class="math inline">{\bf q}</span> is the heat flux.
The objective of the following series of manipulations is to replace the
internal energy <span class="math inline">e</span> on the left-hand side
with the enthalpy <span class="math inline">h</span>, which provides a
form of the thermal-energy equation that is usually more
convenient.</li>
<li>By using the deviatroic stress tensor (Eq.3.141), the thermodynamic
pressure can be separated from the <span class="math inline">{\textsf

{\textsf T}:\nabla{\bf V} = {\textsf T&#39;}:\nabla{\bf V} -
p\nabla\cdot{\bf V}
</span></li>
<li>To show that the <span class="math inline">p\nabla\cdot{\bf

class="math display">
{\textsf p} =
\begin{pmatrix}
p &amp;   &amp;   \\
&amp; p &amp;   \\
&amp;   &amp; p

= p{\textsf I}
</span> where <span class="math inline">{\textsf I}</span> is the

class="math display">
{\textsf p}:\nabla{\bf V} = p\nabla\cdot({\bf V}\cdot{\textsf I})-p{\bf

<li>The overall mass-continuity equation (Eq. 4.10), <span
class="math display">
\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{D\rho}{Dt} = -\nabla\cdot{\bf V}
</span> leads to an alternative way to express the <span
class="math inline">p\nabla\cdot{\bf V}</span> term tat appears in Eq.
4.153. That is, <span class="math display">
p\nabla\cdot{\bf V} = -\frac{p}{\rho}\frac{D\rho}{Dt} =
\rho\frac{D}{Dt}\left(\frac{p}{\rho}\right) - \frac{Dp}{Dt}

</span> where the enthalpy <span class="math inline">h = e +
p/\rho</span> was used.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">p\nabla\cdot{\bf V}</span> term is called
the “flow work”, and it is the work associated with pressure around the
control surfaces. As shown in Eq.X, this term can be expanded in two
terms. One is combined with the internal energy <span
class="math inline">e</span> to introduce the enthalpy <span
class="math inline">h</span>. The other term, <span
class="math inline">Dp/Dt</span>, is fortunately be neglected for most
low-speed flows, as <span class="math display">
\frac{Dp}{Dt} = \frac{\partial p}{\partial t} + {\bf V}\cdot(\nabla p)
</span> and the pressure derivatives and velocities are often small
there. However, since the magnitude of the pressure <span
class="math inline">p</span> can often be large (recall that atmospheric
pressure is <span class="math inline">10^5 Pa</span>), <span
class="math inline">p\nabla\cdot{\bf V}</span> needs to be
retained.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="viscous-dissipation">Viscous dissipation</h3>
<ul>
<li>The thermal-energy equation now has a single term that involves the
viscosity; it is called the dissipation function or viscous dissipation
<span class="math display">
\Phi = {\textsf T&#39;}:\nabla{\bf V}
</span></li>
<li>This term represents the irreversible conversion of kinetic energy
into thermal energy, and must be always be positive. In other words,
irreversible work must increase thermal energy in the flow.</li>
<li>For low-speed flow of gases, viscous dissipation is rarely
important. However, in high-speed flows such as supersonic flows,
viscous dissipation is important. Also for the flow of high-viscosity
fluids like oils in a journal bearing, viscous dissipation must be
considered.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="thermal-energy-equation">Thermal energy equation</h3>
<ul>
<li>The thermal-energy equation is commonly written in the form <span

<li>In this form, the Fourier’s law is substituted for the heat flux.
The thermal conductivity <span class="math inline">\lambda</span> is the

<li>The thermal-energy equation above has no explicit source term to
describe the heat related associated with chemical reaction.
Nevertheless, as stated, the thermal-energy equation does fully
accommodate chemical reaction. As is described subsequently, the thermal
effects of chemical heat release are captured in the enthalpy term on
the left-hand side.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="ideal-gas-1">Ideal gas</h4>
<ul>
<li>The majority of applications considered in this book is the mixtures
of ideal gases. The thermodynamic properties of the mixture that appear
in the energy equation are evaluated as mass-weighted averages of the
individual species properties. Using the mass fraction <span
class="math inline">Y_k</span> and the species’ enthalpy <span
class="math inline">h_k</span>, the enthalpy can be written as <span
class="math inline">h=\sum_{k=1}^K Y_k h_k</span> and this plays a
central role in the thermal-energy equation. From the definition of
<span class="math inline">h</span>, the substantial derivative can be
expanded as <span class="math display">
\frac{Dh}{Dt} = \sum_{k=1}^K\left(Y_k\frac{Dh_k}{Dt} +
h_k\frac{DY_k}{Dt}\right)
</span></li>
<li>For an ideal gas, where the specific heat is defined in terms of
enthalpy as <span class="math display">
c_{pk} \equiv \left(\frac{\partial h_k}{\partial T}\right)_p
</span> or <span class="math inline">dh_k = c_{pk}dT</span>. Therefore,
the enthalpy derivative can be written in terms of a temperature
derivative as <span class="math display">
\frac{Dh_k}{Dt} = c_{pk}\frac{DT}{Dt}
</span></li>
<li>This equation <em>does not</em> imply that specific heats are
constant. Indeed, they are generally the functions of temperature.
Rather, there is not a specific-heat derivative, because of the
definition of specific heat (Eq.X).</li>
<li>Since the mixture specific heat for an ideal gas can be written as a
mass-weighted sum of the specific heat of species, <span
class="math inline">c_p = \sum_{k=1}^K Y_k c_{pk}</span> <span
class="math display">
\frac{Dh}{Dt} = c_p\frac{DT}{Dt} + \sum_{k=1}^K h_k \frac{DY_k}{Dt}
</span></li>
<li>This equation shows that the rate of <span
class="math inline">Y_k</span> change in the mixture contributes
directly to the enthalpy change. Recall from the species-continuity
equation that there are two contributions to the rate of chemical
species change: molecular diffusion across the control surface and
homogeneous chemical reaction within the control volume. Substituting
the species-continuity equation (Eq.X) yields <span
class="math display">
\rho c_p \frac{DT}{Dt} + \sum_{k=1}^K h_k(-\nabla\cdot{\bf j}_k +
\dot{\omega}_k W_k) \\
= \frac{Dp}{Dt} + \nabla\cdot(\lambda \nabla T) -
\sum_{k=1}^K\nabla\cdot h_k{\bf j}_k + \Phi
</span></li>
<li>On expanding the enthalpy-flux term on the right-hand side as <span
class="math display">
\sum_{k=1}^K \nabla\cdot h_k{\bf j}_k = \sum_{k=1}^K h_k\nabla\cdot{\bf
j}_k + \sum_{k=1}^K{\bf j}_k\cdot\nabla h_k
</span></li>
<li>The <span class="math inline">h_k\nabla\cdot{\bf j}_k</span> terms
that appear on both sides cancel. Also, since <span
class="math inline">dh_k = c_{pk}dT</span>, <span class="math display">
\sum_{k=1}^K{\bf j}_k\cdot\nabla h_k = \sum_{k=1}^K c_{pk}{\bf
j}_k\cdot\nabla T
</span></li>
<li>The ideal-gas thermal-energy equation is finally simplified to <span
class="math display">
\rho c_p \frac{DT}{Dt} = \frac{Dp}{Dt} + \nabla\cdot(\lambda\nabla T) -
\sum_{k=1}^K c_{pk}{\bf j}_k\cdot\nabla T - \sum_{k=1}^K
h_k\dot{\omega_k}W_k + \Phi
</span></li>
<li>The physical interpretation of the thermal-energy equation in this
form is that the rate of the temperature change is influenced through
terms involving mechanical compression, heat conduction, diffusive flux
of thermal enthalpy, heat of chemical reaction, and viscous
dissipation.</li>
<li>Note that the “heat source” due to chemical reaction is not really a
source term per se. Chemical reaction breaks and forms chemical bonds,
causing the temperature to increase or fall. However, the total energy
in the system is not altered by the reaction. Rather, potential energy
in the form of chemical bonds is converted to thermal energy in the form
of temperature change. Thus, the temperature form of the energy equation
has a chemical reaction term, whereas the enthalpy (or internal energy)
form does not (e.g. Eq.X).</li>
<li>For low-speed flows, both the mechanical compression <span
class="math inline">Dp/Dt</span> and the viscous dissipation <span
class="math inline">\Phi</span> are very small and can be safely
neglected.</li>
