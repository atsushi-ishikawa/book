# Application
## 7. Heterogeneous Catalysts
* Heterogeneous catalysts have the desirable property that after reaction they are easily separated from the reactants and products. This is an important reason why heterogeneous catalysts are often preferred in industry, in particular for high-volume products, for instance, in the energy sector.

### 7-1. Ammonia synthesis
##### General
* Ammonia (NH3) has attracted considerable attention as a hydrogen (H2) energy carrier for several reasons. First, NH3 is much easier to liquefy and transport than H2 gas. Second, NH3 has a higher volumetric H2 density (120.3 kg-H2 m^-3) than those of liquid H2 (70.9 kg-H2 m^-3) or toluene/methylcyclohexane (47.1 kg-H2 m^-3), which is also considered as a potential hydrogen energy carrier.[Wijayanta, Int.J.Hydrogen.En, 2019]
* NH3 is most widely produced by the Haber-Bosch process. The Haber-Bosch process requires harsh reaction conditions and consumes large amounts of energy.
* Alternative reaction process or better catalysts are desirable.

##### Catalysts
* In the Haber-Bosch process, so-called *doubly-promoted iron catalyst* (Fe-Al2O3-K2O) discovered by Mittasch et al, in 1910 is used.[Mittasch, "Advan.Catalysis", vol2, 81, 1950; Frankenburg, "Catalysis", vol3, 171, 1955]
* More recently, Aika et al. have found that the Ru catal[yst have excellent activity on the NH3 synthesis over the various transition metal elements.[BullChemSocJpn, 44, 3216, 1971; ChemLett, 161, 1973]
* Other than Fe or Ru catalyst, transition metals such as Os, Re, Mo, Co and Ni were reported to be promoted by addition of alkali metal.[BullChemSocJpn, 44, 3216, 1971] It is to be noted that the above metals themselves are known to be active elements.[Mittasch, "Advan.Catalysis", vol2, 81, 1950] Rh, Ir, Pd and Pt are known to have no ability for nitrogen chemisorption[ProcRoySoc, S218, 566, 1953] and very little or no activity for ammonia synthesis.[Frankenburg, "Catalysis", vol3, 234, 1955] Pt has been reported to catalyst NH3 synthesis at very high temperature and pressure.[Zeit.Electrochem, 13, 521, 1907; Jost, ibid, 14, 373, 1908] Rh, Ir, and Pd are known to catalyst ammonia decomposition at high temperature,[Bond, "Catalysis by Metals", 378, 1962], while never reported to catalyst ammonia synthesis.

* Nowadays, the Cs-promoted Ru catalysts supported on MgO (Cs-Ru/MgO) is considered to be one of the second-generation catalysts for large-scale NH3 synthesis.
* Kellog advanced ammonia process (KAPP)

##### Reaction mechanism
* N2 is an extremely stable molecule, owing to its N-N triple bond. To break this bond, energy cost amounts for 9.7 eV, thus gas-phase NH3 synthesis is only possible at extremely high temperatures such as in lightning or in electrical arcs.
* The role of catalyst surface is to provide stabilization of the N atoms during or after dissociation of N2.
* In the present of a Ru catalyst, activation energy is usually larger than 1.0 eV, thus NH3 can be formed at much more moderate temperatures.

* The potash promoter gives rise to a drastic change in the main adsorbed species over iron during the course of NH3 synthesis, from N atom over pure Fe or Al2O3-promoted Fe to imino group over the doubly promoted iron, thus enhancing the rate of NH3 synthesis.[JCatal, 13, 232, 1969; JCatal, 19, 350, 1970]
* Another effect of the potash promoter is enhancement of the rate of isotopic mixing in nitrogen over irion in the presence of hydrogen.[JCatal, 12, 145, 1968]
* These effects on the potash promoter have benn interpreted on the basis of its electron-donating nature.

* One of the pioneering work on the Ru-based NH3 synthesis from theoretical approach is that done by Honkala et al.[Science, 307, 555, 2005]
* To estimate the fraction of B_5 sites as a function of particle size, they calculated the surface energy of all the low-energy facets of Ru and used them in a Wulff construction to give the basic particle shape.
* From DFT calculations, they found that the (001)/(101) edges lower their energy by a reconstruction, in which the edge row of atoms is removed. This process give rise to the steps that contain B_5 sites along the edge.
* Their estimate of the particle morphology is in agreement with the TEM-observed image.
* The lack of active sites on the small Ru particles is in full agreement with an experimental observation.

* The dissociative adsorption of N2 on catalyst surface is widely considered as the rate-determining step, both on Fe and Ru.

* Ertl et al., studied the N2 adsorption on clean Fe(100), Fe(111), and Fe(110) with various experimental methods such as Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), thermal-desorption spectroscopy (TDS), and work-function measurements. They identified (i) the dissociative adsorption of N2 on Fe occurs via Ea of 2.2 ~ 2.5 eV, and (ii) surface nitrides with about 2 atomic layers are formed on the Fe surface.[JCatal, 449, 18, 1977; JCatal, 50, 519, 1977]

* Ertl et al. performed the isotopic exchange reaction ($\ce{^{14}N^{14}N + ^{15}N^{15}N <=> 2 ^{14}N^{15}N}$) on R, and have shown that the dissociation of N2 is indeed a slow and activated process.[]
* The sticking coefficient for the dissociative adsorption is very small, such as $~10^{-13}$.
* However, if the whole catalytic surface were in this state, then the resulting rate of N2 dissociation would be several orders of magnitude lower than the observed rate of NH3 formation. Hence, they concluded that only a small fraction of the total Ru metal surface area of Ru/MgO seemed to be highly active, dominating the rate of NH3 formation.[CatalLett, 36, 229, 1996; JCatal, 165, 33, 1997]

* Using surface science techniques, Ertl and co-workers studied NH3 synthesis under ultra-high-vacuum (UHV) conditions on clean Fe and K-promoted Fe single crystal surfaces.[ApplSurfSci, 1, 103, 1977; JCatal, 49, 18, 1977; JCatal, 50, 519, 1977, ApplSurfSci, 1, 241, 1978; ApplSurfSci, 3, 99, 1979; SurfSci, 111, L711, 1981; SurfSci, 114, 515, 1982; SurfSci, 114, 527; 1982]
* The experimental work comprised the determination of the kinetic parameters, i.e. sticking probabilities, activation energy of adsorption/desorption, and the pre-exponential factor for desorption.
* They constructed a reaction mechanism based on elementary steps with a complete potential energy diagram for the NH3 synthesis over the Fe catalyst, as shown in Fig.X[CatalRev-Sci,Eng, 21, 201, 1980; J.Vac.Sci.Technol, A 1, 1247, 1983; Catalytic Ammonia Synthesis, 1st ed, p109]
* The formation of NH3 occurs via the N2 dissociative adsorption, from a di-$\sigma$ bound molecular chemisorbed $\ce{\alpha-N2}*$ species with stepwise subsequent hydrogenation of N*. The following sequence of elementary steps can be written down for the overall reaction.
$$
\begin{align*}
\ce{N2 + $*$ &-> N2$*$} \\
\ce{N2$*$ + $*$ &-> 2N$*$} \\
\ce{N$*$ + H$*$ &-> NH$*$ + $*$} \\
\ce{NH$*$ + $*$ &-> NH2$*$ + $*$} \\
\ce{NH2$*$ + $*$ &-> NH3$*$ + $*$} \\
\ce{NH3$*$ + &-> NH3 + $*$} \\
\ce{H2 + 2$*$ + &-> 2H$*$} \\
\end{align*}
$$
* Based on the work from Ertl and co-workers, the group of Bowker el al.[ApplCatal, 14, 101, 1985; SurfSci, 197, L223, 1988] and Stoltze and Norskov [PRL, 55, 2502, 1985; J.Vac.Sci.Tech, A 5, 581, 1987; SurfSci, 197, L230, 1988; JCatal, 110, 1, 1988; TopCatal, 1, 253, 1994] constructed microkinetic models for Nh3 synthesis.
* They could show that the kinetic expressions with parameters taken from the single crystal surfaces under UHV conditions could describe the high-pressure kinetics. Thus, in other words, it bridges a pressure cap of about 10 to 12 orders of magnitude.

* The concept of special "active sites" associated with low-coordinated surface atoms was introduced as early as 1925 by Taylor.[Proc.R.Soc.London Ser, A, 108, 105, 1925]
* It was observed directly by using the scanning tunneling microscope (STM) that NO preferentially dissociates at steps on a Ru(0001) surface.[Science, 273, 1688, 1996]
* For the H2/Si(100) system, experiments and DFT calculations have shown that the steps dominate the reactivity.[PRL, 81, 5596, 1998]

* Measurements of the N2 dissociation rate over Ru catalysts show a process with an activation barrier between 0.3 and 0.6 eV.[CatalLett, 36, 229, 1996; JCatal, 165, 33, 1997]
* However, DFT calculations have shown a dissociation barrier of 1.4 eV or even higher barrier.[9, 10]
* STM study by Behm et al.[SurfSci, 251/252, 592, 1991; PRL, 67, 3279, 1991] have shown that the small amounts of Au deposited on a Ru(0001) surface will preferentially decorate the steps. Based on this fact, Dahl et al deposited Au (less than 1% of a monolayer) on Ru(0001) and demonstrated that the Au deposition suppresses the nitrogen coverage and thus the N2 dissociation rate substantially (FigX for Arrhenius plot).[PRL, 83, 1814, 1999]
* From this result, they concluded that the N2 dissociation was dominated by step sites but these are blocked by Au deposition.
* They also performed the DFT calculation for the N2 dissociation over the terrace and step sites of Ru(0001) surface. The calculated activation barrier was 1.9 eV on the terrace site, but it significantly reduced to 0.4 eV on the step site. This is in good agreement with the experimentally-measured value, thus their combined experimental-theoretical work have beautifully shown that the N2 dissociation on Ru surface take place on the stepped sites.

* Up to here, we assumed that the first step of the NH3 formation is the N2 dissociation into N atoms; this route is called as the dissociative mechanism. However, another possibility i.e. the associative mechanism is possible, in which the H-addition to N2 occurs before the N-N bond dissociation.
* The DFT study by Garden et al focused on the role of the associative mechanism in the NH3 synthesis reaction on a stepped Ru(0001) surface. They concluded that, at industrial conditions, the dissociative mechanism should be the dominant pathway however there may be a small contribution from the associative mechanism.[J. Phys. Chem. C 2015, 119, 26554]
* Based on their study, considering both the dissociative and associative mechanism is important in the NH3 synthesis reaction at conditions that is not conventional i.e. high-temperature, high-pressure at B5 site.

### 7-2. Hydrocarbons

#### Fischer-Tropsch synthesis
* In Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis, synthesis gas (a mixture of mainly CO and H2) is converted to liquid hydrocarbons. These can be used as alternative fuel to that obtained from crude oil.
* The main reaction for FT can be schematically written as 
$$
\ce{nCO + 2nH2 -> $-$(CH2)_n$-$ + nH2O}
$$
* There is a practical incentive to reduce non-selective methane and light gas production.
* Several metals such as Ni, Co, Ru, and Fe, have been found to be active in the FT reaction. Of these elements, Fe and Co are most common commercial FT catalysts.
* Co-based catalysts are preferred over Fe-based ones owing to the high activity, high selectivity to long chain hydrocarbons, better catalyst stability in hydrogen rich environment, and lower selectivity to oxygenated compounds.
* The production rates for lumped chain length distributions were often used, where each lump is written using the representative chain number. Then the values of the parameters were estimated by fitting experimental data.

* There is considerable debate about the reaction mechanism of the FT reaction.
* The FT reaction is the a surface polymerization reaction. In such a reaction, one distinguishes initiation reactions, chain growth reactions, and chain termination reactions.
* The key issue concerns the nature of the monomeric single C atom ("C1 intermediate") that is incorporated into the hydrocarbon chain growth.
* Two essentially different mechanistic proposals which describe the reaction steps of the hydrocarbon chain growth reaction, i.e., the carbide mechanism[38] versus the CO insertion mechanism.[53]

1. carbide mechanism
  * the C1 intermediate is formed by initial cleavage of CO molecule.

  * In a consecutive step, the partially hydrogenated $\ce{CH_x}$ intermediate is inserted into the growing hydrocarbon chain.
  * the generation of a $\ce{CH_x}$ intermediate initiates the overall reaction
  * several possibilities for the $\ce{CH_x}$ group to be inserted to the growing hydrocarbon chain, such as CH or CH2.[81,82]
  * the main competing process with the chain growth is the methane formation.
  * in this mechanism, to have long hydrocarbons, both a rate for CO to $\ce{CH_x}$ transformation and the CHx insertion to chain need to be high
  * the C1 intermediate generation from CO is often considered to be rate controlling.

2. CO insertion mechanism
  * the C1 species to be inserted to the hydrocarbon chain still contains the C-O bond, and it is broken only after the insertion of that species into the growing chain.
  * after the initial dissociation of a CO molecule, another CO inserts into the $\ce{CH_x}$ species that has been generated.
  * then the C-O bond of the inserted CO cleaves, and an initial $\ce{C2H_y}$ species is generated.
  * further chain growth occurs by consecutive CO insertion steps into adsorbed hydrocarbon chains, followed by the C-O bond cleavage.
  * in addition to direct CO insertion, insertion of partially hydrogenated intermediate such as CHO or CHOH is proposed.[16,37,69,88,89]
  * since the oxygenates easily desorbs and the chain growth terminates, the production of longer oxygenates will not occur through the CO insertion chain growth mechanism, but occurs through the carbide mechanism.
  * the initial CO dissociation rate has to be slower than the CO insertion to the chain, while the C-O cleavage after insertion into the chain has to be fast.

* The chain growth reaction is to be followed by a chain termination step that liberates adsorbed hydrocarbon from the surface.
* The termination reaction can be due to addition of hydrocarbon, $\ce{\beta-CH}$ cleavage or CO insertion, resulting in the formation paraffins, olefins, and oxygenates.

##### C-C bond formation
* On metal surface terraces, chain growth by recombination of a CH3,ads species with growing alkyl chains has a barrier higher than 200 kJ/mol. This agrees with early extended Huckel method results by Zheng et al.[105], which explained this by the umbrella effect arising when two parallel adsorbed CH3 species become close to each other on a surface. This spatially extended CH bonds then make the first contact, which leads to a repulsive interaction and inhibits the formation of the C-C bonds.
* The recombination of CHx species with x < 3 with a glowing hydrocarbon chain is substantially more favorable because then the umbrella repulsion effect is reduced and other partially occupied orbitals on the CHx species are available to stabilize the activation energy. The Ea values are calculated.[14]

##### CO activation
* On the terraces on Ru or Co, the activation energies of the CO bond cleavage can be in excess of 200 kJ/mol, while activation on step-edge sites may reduce activation energies by 100 kJ/mol ore more.
* On the terraces and surfaces on which direct CO activation has a high activation barrier, a different C-O bond cleavage mechanism may occurs. The C-O bond cleavage through intermediate hydrogen activation of CO and intermediate formyl formation may becomes more favorable.[29-33] On most surfaces, this reduces the overall activation energy to convert CO to CH_x, to approximately 120 kJ/mol. This value appears to be rather insensitive to the surface of the metal.

##### microkinetics
* A classical observation on the product distribution of the FT reaction is that, beyond a chain length of three carbon atoms, within a significant chain length interval the hydrocarbon concentration depends logarithmically on its chain length. The slope of this relation defines the chain growth probability $\alpha$ that is independent of hydrocarbon chain length. This is called the *Anderson-Shultz-Flory (ASF)* product distribution.[134-136]

#### Methane cracking
* Methane catalytic cracking is one of the several approaches to generate CO-free hydrogen.
* Methane cracking has the advantage over the conventional steam reforming process by separating the carbon, which eliminates any cross contamination of the products with COx and reduces the evolution of greenhouse gases.[Int.J.Hyd.En, 35, 12268, 2010; Int.J.Hyd.En, 35, 9801, 2010; Top.Catal, 37, 137, 2006]
* Methane decomposition without a catalyst requires very high temperatures, > 1300 $^oC$. An active catalyst is required to obtain high methane conversion at reasonable temperatures: 500-700 $o^C$ for Ni-based catalysts, 700-950 $^oC$ for Fe-based catalysts, 850-950 $^oC$ for C-based catalysts, and 700-1000 $^oC$ for Co, Pd, Pt, Cr, Ru, Mo, and W catalysts.[Int.J.Hyd.En., 35, 9801, 2010; Int.J.Hyd.En, 33, 2515, 2008; Int.J.Hyd.En., 30, 225, 2005; Int.J.Hyd.En., 32, 4821, 2007]
* A major problem encountered with methane cracking is rapid catalyst deactivation. Catalyst deactivation occurs as carbon accumulates on the catalyst, with carbon of course being one of the reaction products.[Int.J.Hyd.En., 35, 12268, 2010; Int.J.Hyd.En., 30, 225, 2005; Carbon, 45, 1314, 2007]
* The deposited carbon can diffuse through and around Ni to form carbon filaments.
* To achieve maximum hydrogen production and to extend the catalyst lifetime, a balance should be achieved between reaction rate and deactivation rate.

* Catalyst deactivation occurs as carbon accumulates on the catalyst, with carbon of course being one of the reaction products.
* The deposited carbon can diffuse through and around catalyst.
* The carbon might accumulates on the external surface of the catalysts, gradually blocking the active surface until it is completely encapsuled, causing complete deactivation.
* To achieve maximum product yield and to extend the catalyst lifetime, a balance should be achieved between reaction rate and deactivation rate.

#### Methane conversion (general)
* Methane (CH4) is the main component of natural gas (~ 95%), and shale gas (typically > 70%), thus a ubiquitous carbon resource in nature.
* This molecule is quite unreactive due to its C-H bond (439 kJ/mol, $pK_a$ = 48), which is the strongest among the hydrocarbon compounds.
* The activation barrier for the C-H dissociation in gas-phase reaction is extremely high [1_of_Sato], thus methane conversion under mild condition is a challenging issue.

* The methane conversion can be grouped into indirect transformation and direct transformation.
* Indirect transformation includes the conversion of methane to syngas.
* Direct transformation includes oxidative coupling of methane (OCM), non-oxidative coupling of methane, and methanol formation from CH4.

* Currently, CH4 conversion into commodity chemicals or fuels involves indirect route vis synthesis gas (CO + H2). However, this process is highly energy- and capital-intensive, thus direct catalytic route to convert CH4 into higher hydrocarbons are needed.[Renew. Sust. Energ. Rev. 2019, 108, 175–193]
* Oxidative upgrading is one route, which includes ethylene (C2H4) formation, oxygenation to methanol (CH3OH) and/or formaldehyde (HCHO), oxidative halogenation, etc.
* The above route uses thermocatalytic,[Catal. Lett. 2015, 145, 23–39; ChemSusChem 2012, 5, 1668–1686; Appl. Catal. A: Gen. 2001, 222, 145–161; ACS Catal. 2016, 6, 2965–2981; Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2017, 56, 16464– 16483] electrocatalytic,[J. Mater. Chem. A 2020, 8, 15575–15590], and plasma- or electric-field-assisted[Chem. Rec. 2017, 17, 726–738] catalysis.
* Non-oxidative drhydrogenative aromatization [ChemCatChem 2018, 11, 39–52; Ind. Eng. Chem. Res. 2018, 57, 37, 1768-1789] is also investigated.

#### Steam reforming of methane
* Synthesis gas (syngas), the mixture of CO and H2, is an important feedstock to produce liquid hydrocarbons and other useful organic chemicals.
* Syngas is most commonly formed by the steam methane reforming (SMR) reaction, which is 
$$
\ce{CH4 + H2O <=> CO + 3H2}
$$
* Actually, the SMR is the main consumption route for CH4 from natural gas nowadays.
* In a typical industrial reformer, the SMR reaction is carried out at 800-1000 $^oC$ and 14-20 atm, with a H2O/CH4 ratio of ~2.5.[Concepts in Symgas Manufacture, 2011; IndEngChemRes, 53, 16948, 2014; Cata.Rev, 58, 1, 2016]
* For SMR, Ni-based catalysts are preferred in commercial units, although precious metals such as Rh, Ru, Pd, and Pt also display high activity.[Adv.Catal, 102, 65, 2002; JCatal, 144, 40, 1993; AngewChemIntEd, 43, 3685, 2004, JCatal, 225, 116, 2004; Surf.Sci, 603, 3275, 2009, JCatal, 259, 147, 2008]
* Unfortunately, the efficiency of industrial SMR over Ni is severely hindered by carbon deposition, which leads to encapsulation or even destricution of the Ni catalyst particles.[Catal.Today, 111, 103, 2006; JCatal, 209, 365, 2002]
* There is significant interest in catalysts that inhibit carbon deposition yet retain activity to the SMR.
* Seveal alternative reactions have been proposed, such as methane dry reforming and partial oxidation. However, these methods yields H2/CO ratio lower than the SMR, which is undesirable for applications such as fuel cell that require high-purity H2.[IntJ.HydrogenEne, 37, 10444, 2012; Int.J.HydrogenEn, 38, 5215, 2013]
* Therefore it is necessary to improve the SMR technology to reduce heating and steam requirements and achieve cost-efficient H2 manufacture.

##### Reaction mechanism
* Early works on the kinetics of Ni-catalyzed SMR focus on the development of the rate law for the CH4 consumption.[Kinet.Catal, 5, 614, 1964; Kinet.Catal, 12, 367, 1971]
* However, these studies provided few details about the reaction mechanism.
* Aparicio presented the microkinetic modeling.[JCatal, 165, 262, 1997]
* Chen et al also conducted the microkinetic modeling.[ChemEngSci, 56, 1371, 2001]

* The activation of CH4 occurs on the metal surface, which generates adsorbed CH3 and H fragments.
* For the CO formation step, and important question is whether a HCO intermediate is involved or not.[15, 20]
* There are three potential pathways to produce CO from CH* namely (i) recombination of adsorbed C* and O* fragments after initial C-H bond cleavage, (ii) reaction of the CH_ads surface intermediate with adsorbed O* to give a HCO intermediate toward CO, and (iii) the formation of a COH intermediate.
* Besides the CH4 activation and CO recombination, a third important pathway in SMR is water activation to provide the necessary O-containing surface intermediates to remove carbon from the surface. To produce CO, the adsorbed CHx fragments have to react with O* resulting from dissociative water adsorption.
* The direct and O*-assisted water dissociation mechanism is possible. The latter generates the OH* species.

* Using the DFT-based microkinetics, Zhu et al. have compared the reactivity of SMR on Pt(111), Pt(210), Pt(533), Rh(111), and Rh(211) surfaces.[JCatal, 297, 227, 2013] They have found that (i) dissociative adsorption of CH4 is the rate-determining step on Rh and Pt, and (ii) Rh is more active than Pt due to a lower barrier for CH4 activation which is consistent with the stronger metal-carbon bond strength of Rh, (iii) low-coordinated Rh surface atoms are the active sites for the CH4 dissociative adsorption, and (iv) step-edge sites are required for CO formation with low barrier.

* The metal-support interaction and its role in the reaction mechanism is also important topic nowadays.
* For example, Salcedo et al. have carried out a combined experimental-theoretical work on Ni-impregnated CeO2 catalyst system.[ACS Catal, 11, 8327, 2021] The work has shown that the metal-support interaction of Ni/CeO2(111) play favorable role in the SMR; their ambient-pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (AP-XPS) revealed that OH, CHx, and CHxO species are formed at low-temperature such as 300 K.
* They conducted the DFT calculation, and have shown that the OH-assisted CO formation through the COH intermediate undergoes with relatively low activation barrier. This pathway has some role in preventing carbon accumulation on Ni, thus is favorable.

#### Dry reforming of methane
* The dry reforming of methane (DRM) generates the syngas (H2/CO) from CH4 and CO2, without using H2O.[IntJHydroEn, 35, 1630; IntJHydroEn, 34, 9711; CatalToday, 141, 385]
* The reaction is written as follows:
$$
\begin{align*}
&\ce{CH4 + CO2 <=> 2CO + 2H2} &\hspace{5mm}&(\text{DRM})\\
&\ce{CH4 + H2O <=> CO + 3H2}  &\hspace{5mm}&(\text{SRM})\\
&\ce{CO2 + H2  <=> CO + H2O}  &\hspace{5mm}&(\text{RWGS})\\
&\ce{CH4 <=> C(s) + 2H2}      &\hspace{5mm}&(\text{Methane cracking})\\
&\ce{2CO <=> CO2 + C(s)}      &\hspace{5mm}&(\text{Boudouard reaction})
&\end{align*}
$$
* The dry reforming of methane (DRM) is an environmentally friendly reaction because it consumes two greenhouse gases, CH4 and CO2. Another advantage of the DRM is related to the composition of the syngas produced; the syngas from the DRM has lower H2/CO ratio, compared with that produced by other methods, such as coal or steam reforming of methane (SRM).[JCatal, 259, 211] This is advantageous in producing the long-chain alkanes by the Fisher-Tropsch synthesis.[CatalToday, 100,151, IntJHydroEn, 35, 12821]
* The biggest, and inevitable problem in the study of the DRM is that it will be affected by many side reactions, such as SRM, reverse water gas shift reaction (RWGS), methane cracking , and the Boudouard reaction.[JCatal, 343, 196; IntJEnergyRes, 39, 119615,16] This is because the DRM is unavoidably accompanied by the formation of H2O and carbon deposits, which significantly affect the side reactions during the DRM.

##### Catalyst materials
* The most attractive catalyst for DRM might be the supported Ni catalyst, because of its relatively high activity and low cost.
* However, carbon deposition is a severe problem under the reforming conditions, which would lead to rapid deactivation of the catalyst.
* To improve the stability of the catalyst and thus the economic efficiency of the DRM process, it is of vital importance to explore the reaction mechanism under realistic conditions.
* Identification of the RDS is of great importance in DRM.
* Following steps are proposed as the RDS: CHxOH decomposition[ApplCatalA, 142, 97, 1996], the oxidation of CHx species by surface O atom,[JCatal, 224, 370, 2004], the decomposition of CHxO (x = 1-2) into CO and H,[JCatal, 194, 198, 2000] the oxidation of surface C atom by surface O atom.[JCatal, 195, 1, 2000]

##### Reaction mechanism
* The DFT-based microkinetics on the DRM over Ni is investigated by Wang et al.[JCatal, 311, 469, 2014] They included 8 elementary reactions, and have identified that Ni(111) has higher overall reaction rate on the DRM, than that on Ni(211). From the calculated surface coverage, they suggested that the carbon deposition more occurs on Ni(211) than on Ni(111), therefore the Ni flat surface is favorable both from activity and coke resistance viewpoints.

* De Chen and co-workers have conducted the DFT-based microkinetic study on the DRM using Ni catalyst.[IndEngCehRes, 54, 5901, 2015]
* They considered three low-index facets, namely, Ni(111), Ni(100), and Ni(211).
* They found that mainly three pathways contribute to the overall reaction, and the dominant pathway is the successive CH4 dehydrogenation which leads the surface carbon species (C*). The rate-determining step is the oxidation of C* by the surface O atom, namely
$$
\ce{C$*$ + O$*$ -> CO$*$}
$$
reaction.

#### Oxidative coupling of methane
* In the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM), CH4 is partially oxidized to C2 hydrocarbons such as ethane (C2H6) and ethylene (C2H4), as opposed to the complete oxidization (or combustion) that leads CO2. This reaction is a long-standing challenge in the field of catalysis.
* The OCM for generating ethane is expressed as
$$
\ce{2CH4 + 1/2O2 -> C2H6 + H2O}
$$
and subsequent dehydrogenation of ethane to ethyele occurs simultaneously
$$
\ce{C2H6 + 1/2O2 -> C2H4 + H2O}
$$
* Successful OCM is difficult because the C2 hydrocarbon products are more reactive than CH4, and readily undergo non-selective oxidation to COx.

##### Catalyst materials
* Historically, the OCM reaction is first discovered by Keller and Bhasin in 1982.[Keller, JCatal, 1982] They found that a series of metal oxide (Sn, Pb, Sb, Mi, Tl, Cd, Mn) are active in the C2 formation from CH4 in the presence of O2. Later, Ito and Lunsford found the Li-doped MgO is highly effective in the OCM reaction as it gives 38% conversion and 50% selectivity to C2.[JACS 1985]
* Since then, a lot of effort has been devoted to find a better catalyst. 
* However, none of the OCM catalysts developed so far have met the industrial requirements for selectivity and conversion, i.e. ~80% ethylene selectivity at >20% CH4 conversion.[Farrell, ACS Catal., 2016, 6, 4340]
* Not only the Li-doped MgO, La2O3 is considered to be active catalyst.[Ref]
* Currently, one of the best OCM catalyst is Mn-Na2WO4/SiO2.[Li, JCatal, 2003; Elkins, App.Catal.A, 2015]

##### Reaction mechanism
* To provide the better understanding on this difficult reaction, a lot of theoretical works were carried out.
* The OCM is sometimes called "homogeneous-heterogeneous reaction", because not only the surface-mediated reaction but also gas-phase reaction play important role there.
* It is widely accepted that (i) $\ce{CH3\cdot}$ is generated from CH4 by the C-H bond dissociation, which mainly occurs by the surface-mediated reactions, and (ii) C2H6 formation occurs via the couping of $\ce{CH3\cdot}$ in gas phase.[Ref] Thus both surface- and gas-phase-reactions are important in understanding the  whole reaction mechanism.

* Aparicio et al. carried out the microkinetic study on the OCM, and have found that the gas-phase C2 combustion alone cannot account for the observed C2 yield limit.[IndEngChemRes, 1991] Thus the surface-catalyzed C2 combustion is needed to play an important role in determining the selectivity. In this sense, the effective catalysts must be able to produce high $\ce{CH3\cdot}$ concentrations.

* Alijama et al. have performed DFT-based microkinetic on the OCM with alkaline metal oxides (MgO, CaO, and SrO) and have found that C-H bond dissociation is not always the RDS; at weak H binding, the reaction is limited by the C-H bond activation but at strong H-binding the reaction is limited dur to the poisoning of the active site.[JPC.C 2017]

* Shi et al. have proposed that the rate-limiting step is either the formation of $\ce{CH3\cdot}$ or the incorporation of O2 inth the catalyst.[Catal.Today, 1992]
* The importance of the latter step i.e. the regeneration of active sites (by incorporating O2) was also pointed out by Marin et al.[CatalToday, 1994; IndEngChemRes, 1996] They also proposed that the regeneration accompanies the formation and desorption of H2O molecule.
* The same conclusion is also drawn by Shinev et al.; on the Mn-containing mixed oxides, the water evolution is the RDS.[CatalToday, 1994]

* Sun and Marin have performed the microkinetic study on the Li-doped MgO with 39 elementary reactions. They have found that properties such as chemisorption enthalpies, initial sticking probabilities, Eley-Rideal reaction enthalpy, or active site density play important role (thus are "catalyst descriptor") in determining the OCM performance.[CatalToday, 2008]

* There is a long-term controversy on the active site of CH4 activation on the OCM catalysts, particularly on Li-doped MgO. Earlier studies by Landford et al. have proposed that the surface O atom next to the doped Li atom is the active site.[JACS 1985] However, the later DFT study by Kwapien et al. have found that the activation barrier for C-H scission at such site is quite small ($12\pm6\ kJ/mol$) which is different from those found by experimental studies (80-160 kJ/mol).[AngewChem, 2014] Instead, they proposed that stepped site on MgO is the active site for CH4 activation.

* Driscoll and Lunsford have found that, using EPR spectroscopy, $\ce{CH3\cdot}$ is produced on the surface and related int o the gas-phase over the MgO catalyst.[JACS 1985]

* Takanabe et al. have proposed that the H-abstraction from CH4 is mediated by either oxygen species on surface or by OH radicals formed via H2O/O2 equilibration on catalytic surface.[JPC.C, 2009] They also proposed that OCM rates and C2+ yields are higher when H2O is present and OH-mediated pathway prevails, because of the high reactivity of OH radicals.

#### non-oxidative coupling of methane (NOCM)
* NOCM to form C2 hydrocarbons has been considered since the 1990s.
* By only feeding methane continuously, Belgued et al. reported that C2H6 and H2 were immediately produced over a commercial 6 wt % Pt/SiO2 catalyst at low temperature (250 $^oC$).[Nature, 352, 789, 1991] However, owing to catalyst deactivation, both products are no longer generated after 8 min.
* After that, several groups have reported the NOCM on Fe/SiO2,[Science, 344, 616, 2014], PtSn/SiO2.[ACSCatal, 7, 2088, 2017]
* Using Pt-Bi bimetallic catalysts supported on ZSM-5 zeolite, Xiao et al. have reported the NOCM with high C2 selectivity (> 90%) and typical methane conversion of ~2%.[ACSCatal, 8, 2735, 2018] In this bimetallic catalyst, Pt works as the real active site but Bi work as site blocker, attenuating the catalytic activity. The addition of Bi suppresses the over-dehydrogenation of methane which leads coke deposits, than that on the pure Pt.[PCCP, 11, 6225, 2009] As a result, Bi addition to Pt promotes the NOCM selectivity and extending catalyst lifetime.

#### Methanol formation from methane
* The direct conversion of methane to methanol at low temperature using oxygen is one of the long-standing challenges in catalysis.
* Several methods have been suggested, but many of the catalysts know today are prone to overoxidation and the formation of CO2.[ChemSusChem, 5, 1668, 2012]
* However, in nature, methane monooxygenase enzymes are able to catalyze this reaction at room temperature.[Nature, 434, 177, 2005; Nature, 465, 115, 2010; Science, 275, 515, 1997]
* The nature of active sites have served as inspiration for the designing of similar heterogeneous catalysts.
* Particularly promising systems in this context are Cu-exchanged zeolites [PNAS, 106, 18908, 2009; JACS, 137, 6383, 2015; ChemComm, 51, 4447, 2015; Nat.Comm, 6, 7546, 2015] and Fe-exchanged zeolites.[ReactKinetCatalLet, 61, 251, 1997; JCatal, 300, 47, 2013]

* Sushkevish, van Bokhoven et al have presented that a direct stepwise method for converting methane into methanol with high selectivity (~ 97%) over a Cu-containing zeolite.[Science, 356, 523, 2017] With the DFT-calculated Gibbs energy profile, they proposed a reaction mechanism in which the CH4 activation occurs at Cu^{II} oxide active center, and the re-oxidation of the Cu^{I} occurs by O-abstraction from H2O.

#### Ethylene epoxidation - hydrocarbon oxidation
* Ethylene oxide (EO) is one of the largest volume chemicals produced by chemical industry, and currently EO is almost exclusively produced by silver-catalyst supported on $\ce{\alpha-Al2O3}$.
* EO is widely used as chemical raw materials for detergents, polymers, and for many other purposes.
* According to its importance, this procedure is extensively studied both experimentally and theoretically.[1–6]
* A main purpose of these studies was to improve catalyst’s activity and selectivity; the selectivity of EO is 40–50% for unpromoted silver catalyst, but it increases to more than 80% when promoters such as Cs or Cl are used.[7–9]
* Owing to extensive researches, much advance has been made in the understanding of this reaction, but detailed mechanism of this reaction is still far from complete understanding.
* One of the main difficulties arise from the diversity of surface oxygen species, that is, oxygen adsorbed on silver surface takes various forms such as atomically or molecularly adsorbed oxygen, subsurface oxygen, and silver substituting oxygen adatoms.[7],[10–12]
* There have been long arguments on the active oxygen species for epoxidation, that is, atomic oxygen or molecular oxygen.[1–3,13]
* For example, Grant and Lambert[14] and Carter and Goddard[15] thought that the atomic oxygen made by the dissociative adsorption of gaseous O2 is the active species for the ethylene epoxidation.[14,15]
* On the other hand, Campbell, Ayame and other researchers[16–20] have proposed that super-oxide (O2–) adsorbed on silver surface is the active species for the ethylene epoxidation, because a O-O stretching vibrational mode is observed in the IR spectrum.[16] 
* Recent experimental studies indicated that the atomic oxygen is much more stable in the reactive condition and, therefore, should be considered as the active species of the olefin epoxidation.
* For example, in 2004, Lambert and coworkers investigated styrene epoxidation reaction on the Ag(100) surface by synchrotron X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and found that the formation of the atomic oxygen was necessary for the epoxidation.[23]
* In addition, recent experiments have shown that the selectivity limit (85.7%) of the molecular oxygen-based mechanism, so-called 6/7 rule, can be exceeded.[1,2]
* These experiments strongly indicate the atomic oxygen-based mechanism on the clean silver surface rather than the molecular oxygen- based one.
* However, we note that the reaction mechanism under different reaction conditions like in the industrial operating condition is still unclear.
* Recent experiments strongly suggest that silver surface takes different configuration from the clean silver surface,[3,11,24–26] and the molecular oxygen-based mechanism cannot be ruled out for such conditions.
* In addition, there is a strong possibility of O2– as active species for the reactions on step or kink surface sites or nano-sized clusters.[27,28]
* To determine the active oxygen species for olefin epoxidation, the Ag surface structure in an operating condition [high temperature, non-ultra-high vacuum (UHV)] needs to be understood. This is because the Ag surface reconstruction occurs in the presence of O adatoms, thus the active phase may be different from the clean Ag surface.
* This issue is extensively studied both experimentally and theoretically, and it is widely known that the Ag-O surface structure strongly depends on the oxygen coverage.[24]
* On high-coverage surface, Rovida et al.[29] reported the formation of the p(4 3 4) low-energy electron diffraction pattern for O/Ag(111) system.
* Afterward, Campbell[30] and Bare et al.[31] suggested that the topmost Ag layer exists between two oxygen layers. Their “three-layer model” was corrected by Carlisle et al.[32] based on the scanning tunneling microscope (STM) experiment.
* Furthermore, the “(p-T) phase diagram” obtained by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations also supports the stability of their “Ag1.83O layer model” under an operating condition for ethylene epoxidation.[32,33]
* In contrast to the high-oxygen coverage surfaces, the low-coverage surfaces are less understood, although researchers admit that the surface geometry is close to the clean Ag(111) with low-oxygen adatom concentration.[34]
* Interestingly, this low-coverage surface is also stable surface in high-temperature condition, as shown from the (p-T) phase diagram given by Scheffler and co-workers.[35] 
* Therefore, as proposed by many researchers,[24,35] it is natural to think that high- and low-coverage surfaces may coexist in an operating condition, that is, the real active phase in olefin epoxidation is not yet fully determined.
* Clearly, the difficulty is related to the limitation in STM technique; it is not easy to have atomic resolution routinely, and more importantly, ultra-cold and UHV condition is usually requited in STM measurements.
* One of the promising approaches for understanding active phase under operating condition is in situ XPS.
* Recent advances in this technique have made it possible to clarify the nature of the atomic oxygens on a silver surface.
* For example, Schlogl and coworkers carried out the detailed XPS measurements on polycrystalline silver surface in the presence of O2 and ethylene gas at reaction conditions (300–500 K and 0.07–1 millibar).[36]
* In their spectrum, two atomic oxygen states called electrophilic oxygen (Oelec) and nucleophilic oxygen (Onuc) were found.
* These can be clearly distinguished in XPS because they have different O1s core-electron binding energies (CEBEs); Oelec has 530.4 eV, whereas Onuc has 528.3 eV.[36–39]
* Their notable finding was that the EO yield was proportional to the peak intensity of Oelec, whereas Onuc was irrelevant to the EO yield.
* This indicates that Oelec is an active species for ethylene epoxidation, although detailed information such as the adsorption sites of Oelec and Onuc are not yet determined.
* The adsorption site is significantly important to understand the relationship between the surface oxygen states and the catalyst’s activity or selectivity, which is the key information for new catalysts design.
* However, present experimental data are insufficient to fully determine the adsorption sites of Oelec and Onuc on a silver surface, although some important clues were known, as follows; there is an experimental report that the appearance of the O1s signal with 528.4 6 0.1 eV in XPS is accompanied with the formation of the Ag(110)-(231)-O added-row structure.[1,14,15,30],[31,37,39,40]
* This structure is formed by the surface reconstruction of the Ag(110). Thus, this strongly indicates that Onuc, whose O1s CEBE is 528.3 eV, corresponds to the O atom in the added-row structure.
* The geometry of Oelec is less clear, but series of angle-resolved XPS have clarified that these are on-surface oxygen species.[41,42]
* Based on these experimental data, possible adsorption sites were suggested by Schlogl and coworkers,[43] although further studies are necessary to identify real adsorption sites.

### 7-3. CO2
#### Intro
* The reduction of the CO2 atmospheric concentration is a topical need and a real challenge for the scientific community.
* Nowadays, great efforts are made to eliminate or transform CO2 which participates consistently to the greenhouse gas emissions.
* Two main solutions are proposed:
  1. to capture CO2 at its source and store it in the geological subsurface where it will no longer be able to contribute to the global warming,
  2. to promote the transformation of CO2 in the presence of an adequate catalyst at high temperature.
* CO2 is a stable molecule. The C=O bonds in CO2 molecules are quite stable, thus large energy input (heat) must be supplied to dissociate them.
* The transformation of CO2 is energy-demanding when CO2 is used as a single reactant. The reaction is thermodynamically easier if CO2 is used as a co-reactant with other substances with a higher Gibbs free energy, such as H2.
* For example, in the CO2 methanation reaction $\ce{CO2 + 4H2 <=> CH4 + 2H2O}$, the enthalpy is about $\Delta H^{\rm o} = -167\ kJ/mol$. This reaction is reversible and exothermic.

#### CO2 methanation
* One interesting reaction of CO2 is the CO2 methanation reaction, in which H2 gas is used as a reagent to transform CO2 into methane.
* CO2 methanation is considered as a carbon capture and utilization (CCU) technology because it converts CO2 into methane, which can be used as fuel.
* When H2 gas is produced by the electrolysis of water, for example, it does not involve the CO2 emission from the fossil fuels. Moreover, the electricity of the electrolysis is supplied from the power generated by renewable energy source such as solar or wind energy, the CO2 methanation process is definitely the negative CO2 emission technology. Because of this, the CO2 methanation is considered as one of the key reactions to reduce CO2 content in air.
* The reaction formula of the CO2 methanation is given as follows:
$$
\ce{CO2 + 4H2 -> CH4 + 2H2O},\hspace{5mm}\Delta H = -165 \ {\rm kJ/mol}
$$
* This reaction was discovered by Sabatier and Senderens in 1902.[Ref]
* The catalyst exhibits low activity at low temperature; thus a large amount of heat is required for preheating the catalyst bed and feed gas. However, the high temperature condition shifts the equilibrium to the reactant side according to Le Chatelier's principle. Thus catalysts highly active at lower temperature is needed.

##### Catalyst materials
* Ni- and Ru-based catalysts are two of the most popular catalysts employed for this transformation. Even though Ru is more active, its use is limited by high cost and low availability, whereas Ni is cheaper but is less active.
* Ru and Rh catalysts are also extensively studied since they exhibit high activity and selectivity for CH4.[11-13]
* Tada et al. compared the performance of the CO2 methanation over Ni/CeO2, Ni/$\ce{\alpha-Al2O3}$, Ni/TiO2, and Ni/MgO. They found that Ni/CeO2 has the highest CO2 conversion especially at lower temperatures.[IntlJHydrogeEn, 37, 5527, 2012] They proposed that the partial reduction of CeO2 surface could result in the high CO2 conversion.

##### Reaction mechanism
* The catalytic mechanism of the CO2 methanation is extensively studied both experimentally and theoretically. One of the most debated issue is the activation routes of CO2 and CO.
* Researchers proposed several pathways as the direct and indirect transformation route of CO2 and CO are possible. The direct transformation occurs by the C-O bond dissociation, while the indirect route undergoes the hydrogenation of CO2 and CO. The direct transformation of CO2 to CO is quite simple as it undergoes via surface-mediated C-O bond dissociation. In contrast, several possibilities exist in the indirect CO2 transformation because either the O-terminal hydrogenation or the H-terminal hydrogenation is possible. Therefore three pathways for the CO2 activation exists, as follows:[Fitzharris1982, Bothra2013, Vesselli2008, Peebles1983]
$$
\begin{align*}
&\ce{CO2 -> CO + O}& &\text{CO2 direct dissociation} \\
&\ce{CO2 -> COOH$*$ -> CO$*$}& &\text{carbonate pathway} \\
&\ce{CO2 -> HCOO$*$ -> HCO$*$ -> CO$*$}&  &\text{formate pathway}
\end{align*}
$$
* Several groups concluded that either direct CO2 transformation or the CO2 hydrogenation via HCOO\* are kinetically favored over the pathway via COOH\* formation.[Huang2019, Chioresu2019] For example, Huang et al. have analyzed the CO2 methanation on Ni(111) with the DFT, and have found that the activation barriers of the CO2 transformation to CO\*, HCOO\* and COOH\* are 43, 52, and 99 kJ/mol, respectively.[Huang2019] The same conclusion is reached by Mohan et al., who carried out the density functional theory (DFT)-based microkinetic study; they concluded that the CO2 direct dissociation is kinetically and thermodynamically favored [Mohan2021].
* The above issue of the CO2 transformation is intimately related to the subsequent CO transformation, which is another debated issue in the CO2 methanation.
* Using the DFT, Ren et al. compared the methanation with and without CO intermediate by comparing following three pathways;[Ren2015]
  1. CO2 ⟶ HCOO\* ⟶ CO + OH
  2. CO2 ⟶ CO\* + O\* ⟶ C\* + O\* ⟶ CH4,
  3. CO2 ⟶ C(OH)2\* ⟶ CH2O\* + OH ⟶ CH2\* ⟶ CH4.
* They concluded that the pathway 2 is most kinetically favorable, and the rate-determining step (RDS) is the CO dissociation into C\* and O\*. This agrees with the past experimental work by Fitzharris et al.[Fitzharris1986] On the contrary, Huang et al. insisted that the CO activation via hydrogenation is favorable; they proposed that the HCO\* formation from HCOO\* is kinetically and thermodynamically more favorable than HCO\* formation from CO\*.[Huang2019]
* To conclude this issue, the extensive DFT-based microkinetic study was carried out, and it concluded that the direct CO dissociation on Ni(111) is favorable over the CO dissociation via the HCO formation, where the RDS is $\ce{HCO -> CH + O}$[Huang2019].

* It is natural to envisage a different reaction mechanism for the CO2 methanation on Ru from that on Ni surface, mainly because Ru is more oxophilic than Ni; one can expect that the C-O bond cleavage more occurs on Ru.
* Indeed, several groups have proposed that the CO2 activation on Ru occurs via the direct C-O dissociation.[Avanesian, JCatal, 343, 86, 2016; Schlexer, CatalLett., 147, 1871, 2017; Chiorescu, SurfSci, 2019] On the contrary, the DFT study by Zhang insisted that the CO2 hydrogenation on Ru(0001) occurs via HCOO intermediate.[Zhang, RSCAdv, 2014]
* Therefore the mechanism of the CO2 methanation on Ru, especially on the CO2/CO activation is still controversial.

#### Methanol steam reforming
$$
\ce{CH3OH + H2O <=> 3H2 + CO2}
$$

#### Water gas shift reaction
$$
\ce{CO + H2O <=> H2 + CO2}
$$

### 7-4. NOx reduction
* Air pollution form vehicle exhaust gas has been a serious environmental problem, particular in urban areas. To reduce harmful gases from car exhaust, catalytic converters are now widely used. Typically, CO, unburnt hydrocarbons (CHx), and NOx should be simultaneously converted into harmless gasses.
* This is accomplished by using three-way catalysts (TWCs), which primally consist of precious metals such as Rh, Pd, and Pt.
* CO and CHx can be removed by oxidation, whereas NOx is removed by reduction with CO or CHx acting as the reducing agent.
* However, the N-O bond is strong ($631.6\ kJ/mol$) for direct reduction of NOx by CO or CHx in gas phase. Thus, the N-O should be activated by a metal surface. Thus the ability to dissociate the N-O bond is a key requirement for TWCs.[2Deushi]

* Rh catalysts are thought to exhibit high activities toward NOx reduction, because of their capability of facilitating NO dissociation.
* Experimental investigations of the NOx reduction frequently employ a model reaction, such as the NO + CO reaction, which generates N2 and CO2 as the product. This is considered to be a simplified system for evaluating exhaust gas conversion by TWCs.[6-10Deushi]
* Experimental studies have shown that, compared to other transition-metal elements in TWCs, Rh exhibits good catalytic performance toward NO + CO reactions. For example, Kobylinski and Taylor identified the catalytic activity toward NO reduction as Rh > Pt > Pd.[12Deushi]

* The overall NO + CO reaction
$$
\ce{2NO + 2CO -> N2 + 2CO2}
$$
consists of following elementary reactions
$$
\begin{align*}
&\ce{NO + $*$ -> NO$*$}&            &(\text{NO adsorption}) \\
&\ce{NO$*$ + $*$ -> N$*$ + O$*$}&   &(\text{NO dissociation})\\
&\ce{2N$*$ -> N2 + 2$*$}&           &(\text{N2 formation})\\
&\ce{N$*$ + NO$*$ -> N2O$*$ + $*$}& &(\text{N2O formation})
&\end{align*}
$$
* Several experimental studies have suggested that, compared to N atoms, the O atoms are more easily removed by the $\ce{O + CO -> CO2}$ reaction. Consequently, catalyst poisoning by N is considered to be more problematic.[9,21Deushi]
* A few elementary reactions have been proposed for the removal of surface N atoms. For example, two surface N atoms can combine to form N2.
* The $\ce{N + NO -> N2O}$ reaction also occurs because NO molecules are abundant on the surface. Indeed, N2O is one of the major products, especially at lower temperature.[22-24Deushi]
* It is well-known that N2 formation is the main process at moderate-to-high temperatures.[22,23,28-30Deushi]

## 8. Homogeneous Catalysts
* Homogeneous catalysis are typically relatively small molecules that are dissolved in the same solution as the reactants and products.

### 8-1. Gas-Phase Reactions

### 8-2. Reactions in Organic Chemistry

## 9. Electrocatalysis
* Storing renewable electricity in chemical bonds, can be called "electrofuels", is particularly attractive as it allows for high-energy-density storage and potentially high flexibility.

### Electrosynthesis of NH3
* As we have discussed, ammonia (NH3) is usually produced with the Haber-Bosch process i.e. thermal catalysis. However, this is not the only way to generate ammonia.
* In microorganisms which exist in nature and use the enzyme nitrogenase to produce ammonia from solvated protons, electrons and atmospheric nitrogen under ambient conditions. The active site in the enzyme is a $\ce{MoFe7S9N}$ cluster, the $\ce{FeMo}$-cofactor, which catalyzes the electrochemical reaction:
$$
\ce{N2 + 8H+ + 8e- -> 2NH3 + H2}
$$
where this electrochemical reaction is facilitated by consuming 16 adenosine triphosphate (ATP) molecules.
* Such **electrochemical NH3 synthesis** has following advantages over the conventional Habor-Bosch process;
	1. Electrochemical NH3 synthesis can proceed under mild conditions, thus energy consumption is reduced.[Kyriakou, Catal.Today, 2017; Cui, Adv.Ene.Mat, 2018]
	2. It opens the possiblities to use H2O as H2 source, thus one can avoid the use of fossil fuels (i.e. **green hydrogen**)

* Electrochemical NH3 synthesis using solid electrolyte has two half reactions; at anode,
$$
\ce{H2O <=> 1/2O2 + 2H+ + 2e-}\\
\text{or} \\
\ce{H2 <=> 2H+ + 2e-}
$$
* At cathode,
$$
\ce{N2 + 6H+ + 6e- <=> 2NH3}
$$
* The net reaction is 
$$
\ce{N2 + 3H2O <=> 2NH3 + 3/2O2} \\
\text{or} \\
\ce{N2 + 3H2 <=> 2NH3}
$$
* One promising approach for electrochemical NH3 synthesis is to use a fuel cell with a solid electrolyte. Many studies have reported using a solid electrolyte for NH3 synthesis at the gas–solid interface.[DOI: 10.1126/science.282.5386.98; DOI: 10.1016/j.ssi.2006.11.019; DOI: 10.1016/j.cattod.2016.09.006 ;DOI: 10.1039/B004885M]
* This device consists of an anode, a cathode, and a solid electrolyte.
* Water dissociation on the anode generates protons, which are transported to the cathode through the solid electrolyte. Then, at cathode, protons combine with electrons and N2 to produce NH3. The NH3 formation at the cathode is known to determine the overall reaction rate and yield, and extensive efforts have been devoted to find effective catalysts for the cathode reaction.
* For example, several researchers have investigated metal systems such as Ru and Ni. Ru is well known as a suitable catalyst for the thermal NH3 synthesis,[DOI: 10.1246/bcsj.44.3216].
* However, its electrochemical NH3 formation rate is still low, such as 3.0 × 10−13 mol·s−1·cm−2 on Ru/MgO, as observed by Skodra and Stoukides.[DOI: 10.1016/j.ssi.2009.08.001]
* To further enhance the NH3 formation rate, a detailed understanding of the reaction mechanism is necessary.
* Several mechanistic studies based on kinetic measurements or theoretical calculations have been performed.[DOI: 10.1016/j.cattod.2016.06.014. DOI: 10.1002/aenm.201800369. DOI: 10.1002/aenm.201800369]
* Currently, there are two widely accepted pathways for NH3 synthesis: the dissociative mechanism (in which N–N bond dissociation occurs first) and the associative mechanism (in which NHx (x = 1–3) species form before N–N bond dissociation).[DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.83.1814; DOI: 10.1063/1.481103; DOI: 10.1126/science.1106435; DOI: 10.1039/C5CP07363D]
* The Haber–Bosch process is considered to occur through the dissociative mechanism, while many researchers believe that electrochemical NH3 synthesis occurs through an associative mechanism because of its milder reaction conditions.[DOI: 10.1063/1.481103; DOI: 10.1039/C1CP22271F]
* Another important mechanism is the Mars–van Krevelen mechanism, in which lattice N atoms are used for NH3 formation.
* Several researchers have investigated electrochemical NH3 synthesis via this mechanism using a metal nitride cathode.[DOI: 10.1016/j.cattod.2016.06.014; DOI: 10.1002/aenm.201800369; DOI: 10.1039/C4CP04838E; DOI: 10.1021/acscatal.5b01918]

* Another key factor in the electrochemical NH3 synthesis is its competition with the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER);[DOI: 10.1039/B004885M; DOI: 10.1038/srep01145]
$$
\ce{2H+ + 2e- <=> H2}
$$
* H adsorption on the catalyst surface or active site competes with N2 adsorption, and when a negative potential is applied, the HER becomes easier than NH3 formation. These effects are unfavorable for the NH3 formation, because the electronic current are consumed by the HER; the NH3 electrosynthesis has low Faradaic efficiency typically much less than 30%.

* Skulasson et al. have nicely summarized the details on the dissociative and associative mechanisms on both flat and stepped metal surfaces.[PCCP, 14, 1235, 2012]
* Using the DFT, they evaluated the energetics of elementary reactions for the dissociative mechanism

\ce{& NH3$*$ + NH3 -> 2NH3 + 2$*$}
\end{align*}
$$
and the associative mechanism
$$
\begin{align*}
\ce{& N2 + $*$ -> N2$*$} \\
\ce{& N2$*$ + 6H+ + 6e- -> N2H$*$ + 5H+ + 5e-} \\
\ce{& N2H$*$ + 5H+ + 5e- -> N2H2$*$ + 4H+ + 4e-} \\
\ce{& N2H2$*$ + 4H+ + 4e- -> N$*$ + NH3 + 3H+ + 3e-} \\

\ce{& NH3$*$ -> NH3 + $*$}
\end{align*}
$$
* They found the linear relationship between the adsorption energy of $\ce{NHx}$ species and the N atom adsorption energy. As seen in Chapter X, this enables the construction of volcano plots.
* In Fig.X, such volcano plots of four assumptions are shown; (i) dissociative mechanism on flat surface, (ii) dissociative mechanism on stepped surface, (iii) associative mechanism on flat surface, and (iv) associative mechanism on stepped surface.
* On the right legs of the volcanoes, the adsorption of N2 and proton transfer to N2 (N2(g) + H+ + e- -> N2H*) is the rate-determining step for the associative mechanism, while on the left legs the NH + H+ + e- -> NH2 (flat) or NH2 + H+ + e- -> NH3(g) (step) are the rate-determining step. When the dissociative mechanism is assumed, the N2 dissociation is always the rate-determining.
* Another important point in Fig.X is that information on the competing between HER and NH3 synthesis is included there.
* The gray-shaded area indicates the conditions under which the surface will be covered with H atoms, while the white area indicates for which metals the surface will be covered with N atoms.
* For metals at the gray-shared area, the HER more occurs than NH3 synthesis because surface is covered by H atom; because of this, metals such as Rh, Ru, Ir are good catalyst in terms of the volcano plots but actually the NH3 formation rate as HER more occurs. From this figure, only the flat metal surfaces of Sc, Y, Ti and Zr are expected to have some resistance to H poisoning, however the negative bias is needed to drive the NH3 synthesis reaction.

* Some catalyst systems with high N2 dissociation rates (e.g., Ru and Ni) suffer from low NH3 formation rates because of the HER.
* Previously, several groups analyzed the competition of the HER and NH3 synthesis, and have shown that overcoming HER is necessary condition to have high NH3 formation rate.[DOI: 10.1039/C1CP22271F; DOI: 10.1021/acscatal.8b00905]

* Using the graph-convolutional-neural-network, Kim et al found that V3Ir(111), Tc3Hf(111), V3Ni(111), and Tc3Ta(111) surfaces are expected to have lower limiting potential energy than a benchmark Mo(110). They have confirmed the results with the DFT calculation by evaluating the free energy surface.[ChemMater, 32, 709, 2020]

### Water splitting
* Electrochemical water splitting can produce hydrogen from abundant water, using electricity. If the electricity is from renewable energy source, this approach would be a clean process for energy conversion.
* The conversion of solar radiation into fuels can be done in a direct manner, i.e. excited electrons induced by photons or indirect manner, i.e. by electrolysis using a potential difference obtained from photovoltaic cell etc.
* The overall process of water splitting comprises two half reactions: the **oxygen evolution reaction (OER)** and the **hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)**.
* The HER takes place on cathode, and the OER does on anode of the cell. In both cases, effective catalysis is needed.
* Extensive research on this subject has shown that the potential needed to split water at rates provided by the solar flux (e.g., 10 $mA/cm^2$) is limited primarily by the OER, since none of the currently known catalysts for this reaction have and overpotential that is less thant $\approx 230 mV$ at the atove rate.[Mater.Chem.Phys., 14, 397, 1986]
* Thus an important challenge is the discovery and development of OER catalysts that can reduce the overpotential for the OER.
* Precious metals such as Pt, Ru, and Ir-based compounds are well-known electrocatalyst for water splitting.[J. Electrochem. Soc. 2005, 152, J23−J26; J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2012, 3, 399−404]
* Alkaline water electrolysis is now attracting attention because because it allows one to use non-precious metals.
* The main concern of the present alkaline water splitting technology is the sluggish anodic OER.

#### OER
* *Also refer the theoretical section.*

##### Catalytic materials
* A number of metals and alloys have been tested as electrocatalysts. As a result, Ni and some noble metals are thought to be the best anode materials in alcaline and acid solutions, respectively.
* The oxide layer is always formed at the surface in the potential regions at which oxygen evolves, even if an inert metal is used as the anode material. Therefore, the oxide formed on the metal substrate, and it always affects the reaction mechanism and electrocatalysis for the OER.
* Rosmeisel et al. have that the metal oxide has the lower oveerpotential for the OER, compared with the pure metals.
* Among several metal oxides, RuO2 is often used as it has high catalytic activity. Other than RuO2, IrO2 is also used frequently.

* ABO3 perovskite oxides are of particular interest because of their high catalytic OER activities, some of which are comparable to those of noble metal oxides such as RuO2 and IrO2.[NatureCommn, 4, 2439, 2013; AngewChem, 53, 4582, 2014; JPCLett, 3, 399, 2012]

##### Reaction mechanism
* The overall reaction for the OER is written as follows.
$$
\begin{align*}
\ce{2H2O &-> O2 + 4H+ + 4e-}&  &\text{(acidic condition)} \\
\ce{4OH- &-> O2 + 2H2O + 4e-}& &\text{(basic condition)}
\end{align*}
$$
* This reaction is known to be endothermic by 4.92 eV.
* We can consider this reaction includes following four elementary reactions (in acidic condition).
$$
\begin{split}
\ce{H2O + $*$   &<=> OH$*$ + H+ + e-} \\
\ce{OH$*$       &<=> O$*$ + H+ + e- }\\
\ce{O$*$ + H2O  &<=> OOH$*$ + H+ + e-} \\
\ce{OOH$*$      &<=> O2 + $*$ + H+ + e-} \\
\end{split}
$$
* From the Gibbs energy changes along these reaction steps, we can know which step is thermodynamically most unfavorable step: This **potential determining step** of a given pathway is defined as the last step to become exergonic when the external potential is applied. Identifying it might be helpful for the improvement on the OER activity.
* This model is purely thermodynamic and assumes that the kinetic barriers i.e. the proton-transfer processes have easily surmountable barriers.[A. A. Peterson, F. Abild-Pedersen, F. Studt, J. Rossmeisl, J. K. Norskov, Energy Environ. Sci. 2010, 3, 1311–1315] This is indeed confirmed by theoretical study, where the barriers are approximately 0.15-0.25 eV,[V. Tripkovic, E. Skffllason, S. Siahrostami, J. K. Nørskov, J. Rossmeisl, Electrochim. Acta 2010, 55, 7975–7981].

* Quantity often interested is the **overpotential ($\eta$)**. We can calculate it from above $\Delta Gs$ (denoted as $\Delta G_{1-4}$), as
$$
\eta_{\rm OER} = \max[\Delta G_1, \Delta G_2, \Delta G_3, \Delta G_4] - 4.92/4
$$
* Note that the reaction Gibbs energy (4.92 eV) is divided by four, which is a number of elementary reactions.
* There is also a related word i.e. **theoretical limiting potential** of electrochemical reaction, which is defined as the minimal potential applied when all the steps become downhill in energy.
* The Gibbs energy change is calculated as $\Delta G = \Delta E  + \Delta ZPE - T\Delta S - eU$. Here, $E$ means total (electronic plus nuclear repulsion) energy, which is often calculated by first-principle method. $ZPE$ is the zero-point vibrational energies. $U$ is the potential difference between electrode and counter electrode. Therefore, we can change $\Delta G$ by varying $U$. This is a great advantage of electrochemical reactions over the conventional catalytic reactions in gas and solid phases.

* Man et al compared the energetics of the OER over various oxides i.e. rutile, perovskite, spinel, rock salt, bixbyite.[ChemCatChem, 3, 1159, 2011] They found a universal scaling relationship between the binding energy of OOH* and OH*
* This relationship led to an approximately constant difference between the binding energy of OOH* and OH*, which in turn defines the lowest possible theoretical overpotential for the OER on a wide variety of oxides.
* They also found that most of the oxides suffer from high overpotential for OH* formation, arising from the suboptimal O* binding.
* As a result, the difference in the Gibbs energy of adsorption $\Delta G_{O*} - \Delta G_{OH*}$ could be a good descriptor for evaluating overpotentials.
* According to their analysis, RuO2 has near-optimal energetics on the OER. This confirms the experimental trend.

##### Using Pourbaix diagram
* Bajdich et al. employed the DFT-calculated Pourbaix diagram to the OER by the cobalt oxides. Their calculated (volume) Pourbaix diagrams shows that $\ce{\beta-CoOOH}$ is the active material in alkaline condition.[JACS, 135, 13521, 2013]
* From the 2D-activity map of overpotential vs. ($\Delta G_{\rm OH}, \Delta G_{\rm O}-\Delta G_{\rm OH}$), they demonstrated that the overpotential can be lowered by substituting surface cobalt atoms by nickel atoms.

##### Descriptors
* Rossmeisl et al. have found that, for metals and rutile oxides, the oxygen atom binding energy is a good descriptor for the OER activity.[Chem.Phys., 2005, 319, 178; J. Electroanal.Chem., 2007, 607, 83] The scaling relationship of OH, OOH, and O binding energy on surface enables one to write the volcano plot between the OER activity and the O atom binding energy. For the surfaces that binds oxygen too strongly, the potential is limited by the OOH* formation, whereas for surfaces that bind oxygen too weakly, the potential is limited by the OH oxidation.

* Santivich et al. proposed that the highest OER activity can be attained when the $e_g$ occupancy of the B-site transition metal is close to unity.
* Transition metal ions with $e_g^1$ electron configurations enhance the covalency with oxygen atoms, leading to effective charge transfer in the RDS.

* Shao-Horn et al. have analyzed the experimental OER activity of 51 perovskites with the machine-learning type methods; they employed five descriptor families (oxide's metal-oxygen covalency, electrostatics, structure, exchange interactions, transition metal electron occupancy). They concluded that the number of d electrons and charge-transfer energy (covalency) were found to play the most important roles, while other factors such as $e_g$ occupancy or M-O-M bond angle are in secondary place. They also insisted that the linear combination of descriptors is still necessary for obtaining the good predictive performance, than the regression model with one or two descriptors.[J. Phys. Chem. C 2016, 120, 78−86]

#### HER

#### ORR
* Low-temperature fuel cells are attracting considerable interest as a means of producing electricity by direct electrochemical conversion of hydrogen and oxygen into water.[Markovic, N. M.; Ross, P. N. CATTECH 2000, 4, 110.] However, there are severe shortcomings of the present technology, which need to be overcome to make low-temperature fuel cells more economically attractive.
* One of the most important problems is related to the low rate of cathode reaction where **oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)**, which occurs as
$$
\ce{O2 + 4H+ + 4e- -> 2H2O}
$$
in acidic aqueous solution. When basic solution is used, it becomes as follows;
$$
\ce{O2 + 2H2O + 4e- -> 4OH-}
$$

#### Catalytic materials
* Pt is commonly used electrode material, but there is a considerable overpotential associated with this reaction over Pt.

#### Reaction mechanism
* Norskov et al. have shown that, based on the DFT-calculated energetics, for Pt(111) the adsorbed oxygen tend to be so stable at high potentials that the proton and electron transfer becomes impossible.[J.Phys.Chem.B, 108, 17886, 2004] By lowering the potential, the stability of oxygen decreases and the reaction may proceed. This is suggested to be the origin of overpotential for ORR over Pt.
* They analyzed both the dissociative and the associative mechanisms. The dissociative one in acidic solution occurs as follows;
$$
\begin{align*}
\ce{& 1/2O2 + $*$     & &-> O$*$} \\
\ce{& O$*$ + H+ + e-  & &-> OH$*$} \\
\ce{& OH$*$ + H+ + e- & &-> H2O + $*$}
\end{align*}
$$
* On the contrary to the above, O2 does not dissociate before it is hydrogenated in the associative mechanism;
$$
\begin{align*}
\ce{& O2 + $*$             & &-> O2$*$} \\
\ce{& O2$*$ + ( H+ + e- )  & &-> OOH$*$} \\
\ce{& OOH$*$ + ( H+ + e- ) & &-> O$*$ + H2O} \\
\ce{& O$*$ + ( H+ + e- )   & &-> OH$*$} \\
\ce{& OH$*$ + ( H+ + e- )  & &-> H2O + $*$}
\end{align*}
$$
* Here the peroxy intermediate is involved, therefore the associative mechanism is also referred as the peroxo mechanism.
* The effect of the electrode potential $U$ on the potential energy diagram was brought about by shifting the energy of electron by $-eU$.
* At a pH different from 0, they corrected the free energy of $\ce{H+}$ by the concentration dependence of the entropy, i.e. $G(pH) = -kT\ln[\ce{H+}] = kT\ln 10 \times pH$.
* The relationship $U = 0\ V$ corresponds to the reaction running by short circuiting the cell or the gas-phase hydrogen oxidation reaction.
* At $U = 0\ V$ condition all the elementary steps are strongly exothermic. However, if the chemical potential of the electrons are shifted by equilibrium potential of $U_0 = 1.23\ V$, then both electron/proton-transfer steps become uphill, and therefore one of the elementary steps should be the rate-limiting.
* In other words, adsorbed oxygen and hydroxide on the Pt(111) are thermodynamic sinks for the oxygen reduction process, and the activation barrier for the total process at the maximum cell voltage $U_0 = 1.23\ V$ is at least $\Delta G_1(U_0) = 0.45\ eV$. This value is close to the experimentally observed overpotential.

* If one assumes that the activation barrier is the same with the $\Delta G$ of the rate-limiting step, the rate constant for the reaction can be written as
$$
k(U) = k_0 \exp[-\Delta G(U)/k_B T]
$$
* The prefactor $k_0$ includes all the details of the proton transfer to the surface and recombination with the electron.
* In units of current density, the rate constant is
$$
i_k(U) = 2e\frac{N_{\rm sites}}{A}k(U) = \tilde{i_k}\exp[-\Delta G(U)/k_B T]
$$
where $N_{\rm sites}/A$ is the number of sites per surface area.
* The exchange current rate constant becomes
$$
i^0_k = \tilde{i_k}\exp[-\Delta G(U_0)/k_B T]
$$
which leads to the usual Butler-Volmer type relation
$$
U = U_0 - b\log_{10}\frac{i_k}{i_k^0}
$$
where the Tafel slope is $b = k_BT\ln10/e = 60\ mV (300\ K)$. This value is consistent with experiment.

##### Using Pourbaix diagram
* The surface structure is obviously important for the catalytic activity.
* Norskov et al have, using the DFT, constructed surface Pourbaix diagrams for Ag, Ni, and Pt(111) surfaces at potentials relevant for OER.[PCCP, 10, 3722, 2008]
* These diagrams hsows the most stable surface structure as a function of pH and potential.
* It is found that the coverage of O* and OH* is independent of pH at a given potential (vs. RHE) whereas the potential of dissolution is not.

##### Descriptors
* Perovskite transition-metal oxides can exhibit high electrocatalytic activity for ORR in alkaline electrolytes.[J. Electrochem. Soc. 2010, 157, B1263−B1268.; Nat. Chem. 2011, 3, 546−550]
* It is suggested that the ORR activity on perovskite oxide surfaces is related to the $e_g$ occupation in the B-site cation, which is an indicator for the bond strength between transition metal and adsorbed oxygen.
* A moderate amount of $e_g$-filling in perovskite oxides such as LaMnO3 ($e_g = 1$) yields higher activity than other oxides such as LaCrO3 ($e_g = 0$) or LaFeO3 ($e_g = 2$).
* Wang et al. compared the GGA, GGA+U, and hybrid functional results on LaMO3 (M = Mn, Fe, Cr); they found the hybrid functional gives best agreement with the experimental results.[J. Phys. Chem. C 2013, 117, 2106−2112]

#### CO2 electroreduction
* CO2 is a greenhouse gas that can be used for production of useful fuels or fuel cell stock such as methane and ethylene. The electrochemical reduction of CO2 to hydrocarbon fuels is an emerging technology, which has the advantage of being performed under ambient temperature and pressure.
* In contrast to hydrogen production by water electrolysis, CO2 electrolysis is still far from a mature technology.
* Significant hurdles regarding energy efficiency, reaction selectivity and overall conversion rate need to be overcome if electrochemical CO2 reduction is to become a viable option for storing renewable electricity.
* Large overpotentials are needed to produce significant reaction rates and the selectivity toward the desired products are often low, with hydrogen evolution being the major competing process.[1-4]

* Theoretical works employing DFT and various descriptors of the electrochemical interface have usually focuses on the mechanism on Cu, which is the only pure transition metal capable of reducing CO2 to alcohols and hydrocarbons at reasonable faradaic efficiencies.[19-25]

* As a technology currently in development, it can benefit from accomplishments in the proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) technology.
* As in the ORR, the CO2 reduction reaction occurs at the cathode of a CO2 electrolyzer.
* Depending on the metal catalyst, CO2 electroreduction products may include CO, formic acid (HCOOH), alcohols, methane, and ethylene.
* The net reactions that occur on metal electrodes in aqueous solution at pH = 0 versus standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) are shown below:
$$
\begin{align}
\ce{ CO2 +  2H+ +  2e- &<=> CO + H2O},     &-0.103 \ V \notag\\
\ce{ CO2 +  2H+ +  2e- &<=> HCOOH + H2O},  &-0.225 \ V \notag\\
\ce{ CO2 +  8H+ +  8e- &<=> CH4 + H2O},    & 0.169 \ V \notag\\
\ce{2CO2 + 12H+ + 12e- &<=> C2H4 + 4H2O},  & 0.079 \ V \notag\\
\ce{ CO2 +  6H+ +  6e- &<=> CH3OH + H2O},  & 0.020 \ V \notag\\
\ce{2CO2 + 12H+ + 12e- &<=> C2H5OH + 3H2O},& 0.090 \ V \notag\\
\end{align}
$$
where the values represents the standard equilibrium potential $E^0$.
* The two-electron transfer products, CO and HCOOH, can be produced with low overpotential and high Faradaic efficiency on suitable electrocatalysts, but substantially higher overpotentials and lower selectivities are observed for multi-electron transfer products such as methane, ethylene, and alcohols.[Durst, J. et al. Electrochemical CO2 reduction — a critical view on fundamentals, materials and applications. Chim. Int. J. Chem. 69, 769–776 (2015)]
* The interest in making more reduced (liquid) products from CO2 lies in the fact that they have higher energy density and economic value. Therefore, elucidating the pathway(s) from CO2 or CO to C2 products, of which ethylene and ethanol are the most typical examples, has been subject to several studies.
* Cu is the only metal yet reported to convert CO2 into ethylene at Faradaic efficiencies above 5%.[(2) Kuhl, K. P.; Hatsukade, T.; Cave, E. R.; Abram, D. N.; Kibsgaard, J.; Jaramillo, T. F. Electrocatalytic Conversion of Carbon Dioxide to Methane and Methanol on Transition Metal Surfaces. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2014, 136, 14107−14113; Kuhl, K. P.; Cave, E. R.; Abram, D. N. New Insights Into the Electrochemical Reduction of Carbon Dioxide on Metallic Copper Surfaces. Energy Env. Sci. 2012, 5, 7050−7059]
* Two separate pathways from ethylene production have been observed experimentally: a high-overpotential pathway involving a shared intermediate with the methane pathway, taking place mainly on Cu(111). Another one is the low-overpotential pathway taking place mainly on Cu(100), which does not yield C1 products.

* The first step in the CO2RR is the activation of CO2 molecule. It is often claimed that activation and reduction of CO2 is difficult because the first electron transfer to form $\ce{CO2^{.-}}$ has a very negative redox potential (-1.9 V vs. NHE).
* However, electrocatalysis stabilize $\ce{CO2^{.-}}$  or reaction intermediate by forming a chemical bond between CO2 and catalyst, leading to a less negative redox potential.
* *COOH is considered as the first intermediate for CO formation, while *OCHO is more likely to be the intermediate for HCOOH formation.
* For the formation of C2+ products, two pathways have been identified with regard to the C-C coupling step:
	1. CO* dimerizes to form OCCO* species at low overpotentials
	2. CO* is hydrogenated to form CHO* species, a common intermediate for the methane formation, which takes place at high overpotentials

* In 2020, Zhong et al. carried out the combined experimental-theoretical to discover the novel catalyst system for the CO2 electroreduction.[Nature, 581, 178, 2020] They performed large-scale DFT calculation (244 copper-containing crystals and 12,229 surfaces), and analyzed the results with the t-SNE which is one of the machine-learning algorithm for clustering and dimension reduction. Their analysis have found that (i) moderate CO adsorption (~ -0.67 eV) is the key for the CO2 reduction TOF, and Cu-Al bimetallic system is favorable catalyst from this viewpoint, and (ii) detailed configuration of the Cu-Al cluster is important to have optimal CO adsorption, and adsorption site with a higher Cu content than Al is desirable. Based on this computational result, they synthesized the Cu-Al catalyst with the high Faradaic efficiency (~ 80%); this is much higher than that of pure Cu (~ 66%).

#### Chlorine evolution reaction
* Chlor-alkali electrolysis constitutes the second largest industrial electrochemical process with an annual production of more than 70 million tons of gaseous chlorine.[Ullmann’s Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, Germany, 2012; Chem. Rev. 116, 2982–3028, 2016; Chlorine Industry Review 2016–2017]
* The anode material consists of Ti plates coated with TiO2-RuO2 mixed oxides, commonly denoted as dimensionally stable anodes (DSA).[Electrochem. Soc., 127, 303C–307C, 1980; Platinum Met. Rev., 42, 27–33, 1998; Anal.Chem., 83, 7645–7650, 2011] Among this material, RuO2 has been identified as active component of the DSA for electrochemical chlorine evolution (CER),[Electrochim. Acta, 45, 2377–2385, 2000]
* The CER is known to have a selectivity problem because the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a competing side reaction in the same potential window of CER.[ChemSusChem, 5, 1897, 2012; Angew. Chem. Int. Ed., 53, 11032–11035, 2014; Electrocatalysis, 6, 198–210, 2015; J. G. Vos, M. T. M. Koper, J. Electroanal. Chem. 2018, 819, 260–268.; JACS, 140, 10270, 2018]
* From a thermodynamic viewpoint, the OER is preferred over the CER because its equilibrium potential ($U^0$) is smaller (1.23 V) than that of the CER (1.36 V). However, in terms of kinetics, the CER is advantageous as it is a faster two-electron process ($\ce{2Cl-(aq) -> Cl2(g) + 2e-}$) while the OER requires the transfer of four electrons ($\ce{2H2O(aq) -> O2(g) + 4H+(aq) + 4e-}$). As a result, the exchange current for the OER is low due to the kinetic limitation, and thus the CER prevails over the OER above 1.36 V.
* The equilibrium potential of the CER is independent of the pH. On the other hand, the equilibrium potential of the OER is increased by decreasing pH. Thus the selectivity can be shifted toward the CER by keeping the low pH. This finding gives reasoning, why the chlor-alkali process is carried out in an acidic environment, since only under these conditions the CER predominates over the OER.[Chem. Rev., 116, 2982–3028, 2016; ACS Catal, 7, 2403, 2017]

* Understanding the surface structure of catalysts is a starting point for analyzing the reaction mechanism. For this purpose, several grpus have calculated a Pourbaix diagram by the ab initio calculation.[Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 12 (2010) 283; Electrochimica Acta 120 (2014) 460–466] The diagram reveals that oxygen bound on-top of Ru_{cus} atoms is stable over a wide potential and pH range, in particular for U > 1.36 V where both the CER and OER take place. At slightly higher potentials (U < 1.49 V) and for pH < 4, the terminal adsorption of Cl on O_{ot} is energetically favored, therefore this adsorbate structure can be considered as a precursor for the CER.
* For pH > 4 and U > 1.4 V, another surface structure becomes energetically preferred. This surface structure with the OOH_{ot} reaction intermediate surves as a precursor for the OER over RuO2(110), while the CER cannot occur on this surface structure. Therefore, the transition from the fully O-covered RuO2(110) surface to this surface is indicative of the OER.
* Their work above have clearly shown that the ab initio Pourbaix diagram constitute the starting point for the reaction mechanism analysis for the electrochemical reaction, as the stable surface structure is divergent and dependent on conditions such as pH or voltage.

* In a first-principles kinetics study,[AngewChem, 55, 7501, 2016] the reaction mechanism of the CER over the active RuO2(110)-O_{ot} surface was ascribed to the pathway of Volmer-Heyrovsky.[Electrochim.Acta, 22, 1093–1100, 1977; S. Trasatti, G. Lodi, in: S. Trasatti, Electrodes of Conductive Metallic Oxides Anodes, Part B, Elsevier, 1981]
* This mechanism comprises the adsorption and discharge of a chloride anion on the active Ru_{cus}-O_{ot} site in the Volmer step, which is followed by the direct recombination of the adsorbed chlorine species in the Ru_{cus}-OCl_{ot} precursor with another chloride anion from the electrolyte solution; this step is called the Heyrovsky step.

* The CER over RuO2(110) requires the formation of the O_{ot} and the OCl_{ot} adsorbate, in which either the Volmer step or the Heyrovsky step constitutes the rate-determining step (RDS).
* For small overpotentials, i.e. $\eta_{\rm CER} = U - U^0_{\rm CER} < 0.10\ V$, the Heyrovsky step governs the kinetics, while the RDS switches to the Volmer step if the applied overpotential is raised ($\eta_{\rm CER} > 0.10\ V$).[AngewChem, 55, 7501, 2016; ACS Catal, 8, 1864– 1879, 2018]

* Ab initio theory [J. Am. Chem. Soc., 132, 18214–18222, 2010] identified the formation of the OOH_{ot} adsorbate as the RDS in the OER, which was confirmed later by a combined experiment-theory approach.[ACS Catal., 8, 1864– 1879, 2018; ChemElectroChem, 4, 2902–2908, 2017]
* Consequently, at typical overpotential of industrial electrolysis i.e. $\eta_{\rm CER} > 0.10\ V$ ($\eta_{\rm OER} > 0.23\ V@pH=0$), the OCl_{ot} adsorbate and the OOH_{ot} adsorbate govern the activity of the CER or the OER, respectively.
* Based on this idea, it is suggested to employ the free energy difference of the limitig OOH and OCl adsorbate i.e. $\Delta G({\rm OOH}) - \Delta G({\rm OCl})$, as a measure for stability and CER selectivity, in that the spacing between the limiting adsorbates ought to be maximized for improved performance in the electrocatalytic CER over transition-metal-oxide-based electrodes.

* To determine the potential of an electrochemical cell, the reference electrode is necessary. The most common reference electrode is the **standard hydrogen electrode (SHE)**, which is based on the redox reaction
$$
\ce{H+(aq) + e- <=> \frac{1}{2} H2(g)}
$$
that occurs at a Pt electrode.
* The concentration of $\ce{H+}$ and H2 is maintained at unity, which implies the pressure of H2 gas is 1 bar and the activity coefficient of $\ce{H+}$ is unity.
* In the theoretical simulation, an approximate version of SHE called **the computational hydrogen electrode (CHE)** is often used. Here, the chemical potential of $\ce{H+}$ and $\ce{e-}$ pair as one half of the chemical potential of a H2 molecule. Thus, by evaluating the chemical potential of H2, one can estimate the chemical potentials of $\ce{H+}$ and $\ce{e-}$; this is a merit as bare protons and electrons are difficult to treat in computational method. Using this CHE, when the potential $U_{\rm SHE}$ is applied (versus the SHE), $\mu_{\ce{H+}}$ and $\mu_{\ce{e-}}$ are
$$
\begin{align*}
\mu_{H^+} + \mu_{e^-} 
&= \frac{1}{2}\mu_{H_2} - eU_{SHE} + k_BT \ln(10) \times pH \\
&= \frac{1}{2}\mu_{H_2} - eU_{SHE} -0.059 \times pH (\text{at 298.15 K})
\end{align*}
$$
at some fixed pH.
* Therefore, one can evaluate the dependence of the thermodynamic quantities (such as the reaction Gibbs energy $\Delta G$ of elementary reactions) on $U_{\rm SHE}$ easily.

* Here, we mention another common reference electrode, the **reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)**. The potential of RHE is evaluated as
$$
\begin{align*}
U_{\rm RHE} 
&= U_{\rm SHE} + \frac{k_BT}{e}\ln10\times pH \\
&= 0.00 - 0.059\times pH (\text{at 298.15 K
})
\end{align*}
$$
* Unlike the SHE, its measured potential *does* change with the pH. In other words, the activity coefficient of $\ce{H+}$ is not unity but corresponds to that of the electrolyte solution. Because of this property, the RHE can be directly immersed in the actual electrolyte solution. This is practically useful than the SHE, which should be separated by a salt bridge.


* CHE-based models typical assume concerted **proton-electron transfer (CPET)**, thus the process via **sequential proton-electron transfer (SPET)** cannot be treated.
* CPET is also called **proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET)**.
* When the yield, rate etc. is pH-dependent, it suggests that the rate-determining step is not CPET.

## 10. Photocatalysis
* Photocatalysis uses the energy of light to induce chemical reactions that hardly undergoes with the thermal energy.
* Endergonic reactions such as water splitting or steam reforming of methane undergoes by using photocatalysis, exceeding the thermodynamic limitation.[9,10_of_Sato]
* On the surface of photocatalysts, oxidation or reduction reaction are induced by the photo-generated holes or electrons.
* The exact character of such hole or electrons on surface are often debated.

* In the photocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) from H2O, the activation of H2O
$$
\ce{H2O + h+ -> OH^{.} + H+}
$$
is known to be the rate-determining step.[34_of_Sato]
* TiO2 and WO3 are the most widely used photocatalyst, thus these materials are featured in this section.

#### TiO2
* In 1972, Fujishima and Honda reported the production of H2 from photocatalytic water splitting by TiO2.[Nature. 1972, 238 (5358), 37–8]
* This feature of TiO2 is quite advantageous in many respects, such as solar cells or environmental clean-up; by utilizing photocatalytic reactions, air pollutants such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulphur oxides (SOx) can be removed. 
* This material has high catalytic activity, and has a lot of advantages such as good stability, nontoxicity to human body, and low cost.[Rev Adv Mater Sci. 2018, 55(1), 1–11]
* Hence, the TiO2 is widely used in our daily life nowadays. For this reason, it is natural that the TiO2 is one of the most extensively studied materials in the field of photocatalysis.[Nanotechnol Rev. 2019, 8(1), 671–80]

* The photocatalytic process consists of the following steps:
  1. photoexcitation: an electron-hole pair is generated by the adsorption of light equal to or greater than the band gap of the photocatalyst.
  2. the electron-hole pair dissociates into a free electron and a free hole and then migrates to the reactive surface.
  3. the free electron/hole is transferred to an adsorbed molecule and further undergoes photoreduction/photooxidation.

* TiO2 has relatively wide band gap (Eg = 3.0-3.2 eV), thus it does not effectively absorb visible light. [Energ Env Sci. 2016, 9(2), 411–33]
* This is one of the several reasons why the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 nanoparticles remains low (~ 6%).

* Three main crystal types of TiO2 have been identified in nature, namely, brookite, rutile, and anatase.[Prog Solid State Ch. 2004;32(12):33–177] Both rutile and anatase TiO2 belong to the tetragonal system, while brookite TiO2 belongs to the orthorhombic system. The structure of brookite TiO2 is unstable, and its preparation is relatively difficult.[B Korean Chem Soc. 2009;30(2):402–4; Ref] Therefore, it is usually used for basic research and rutile and anatase TiO2 play a major role in the field of photocatalysis applications.
* According to recent studies, the photocatalytic property of rutile phase TiO2 is slightly lower than anatase phase TiO2.[Polym Degrad Stabil. 2018;150:31–6; Phys Lett A. 2016;380(16):1462–8 ; Mater Chem Phys. 2017, 186:333–40] In fact, the energy gap of rutile phase (3.0 eV) is narrower than the anatase phase (3.2 eV), and the energy required for electrons to be excited to transition is relatively small; therefore, the light response range of rutile TiO2 is wider. However, the rutile TiO2 tends to have a larger particle size and form an agglomerated structure, leading to easy recombination of the electron-hole pairs.[J Phys Chem Lett. 2017;8(22):5593–8.] Conversely, the crystal of the anatase TiO2 has more defects and dislocations, which increase the separation of electron-hole paris generated in this crystal. Because of this, photocatalytic property of anatase TiO2 is stronger than the rutile TiO2.
* The energy band structure of semiconductor TiO2 contains a valence band (VB), a conduction band (CB), and a region between the CB and VB called the band gap ($E_g$).
* The formula used to calculated the band gap is $E_g = E_{VB} - E_{CB}$, where $E_{CB}$ corresponds to the bottom potential of the CB, and $E_{VB}$ corresponds to the top potential of VB.[79, 80Review]
* When the energy of the incident photon is equal to or greater than the $E_g$ of TiO2, the electrons in the VB will shift to the CB, and the holes will be generated in the VB, thus forming a photogenerated electron ($e^-$) and hole ($h^+$) pair.[Nanotechnol Rev. 2018, 7(3):247–55; Adv Mater. 2019, 31(50):1901997]

##### Water splitting
* As seen in Section X, the water splitting process consists of thwo half-reaction i.e. the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the anode, and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the cathode of a (photo)electrochemical cell. Of the two, the OER is the major obstacle as it generally requires a large overpotential. This difficulty also exists for TiO2 anode.
* In the photocatalytic water-splitting reaction, the adsorption state of water molecules on the surface of TiO2 will directly affect its catalytic activity. Therefore a lot of theoretical works have focused on the interfacial adsorption configuration of water molecules and TiO2, but controversies still exist regarding the adsorption morphology and structure of water molecules.
* The most controversial question is whether water molecules self-dissociate or not on the TiO2 surface.[Front Phys. 2018, 13(3):138107; J Chem Eng Data. 2018, 63(7), 2420–9]

* Currently, it is generally agreed that the oxidation of water is initiated by the formation of surface-trapped photoholes; these holes ($\ce{h+}$) can oxidize water to O2 through the following four sequential proton coupled electron transfer (PCET) steps;[JPC.C, 112, 9872, 2008]
$$
\begin{align*}
\ce{& H2O$*$ + h+ & &-> OH$*$ + H+} \\
\ce{& OH$*$ + h+  & &-> O$*$ + H+} \\
\ce{& O$*$ + H2O(l) + h+ & &-> OOH$*$ + H+} \\
\ce{& OOH$*$ + h+ & &-> O2 + H+}
\end{align*}
$$
* Among them, either the first or the second step is considered as the rate-determining step of the OER.
* DFT study by Selloni et. al have shown that the first PCET occurs is actually a sequential PCET where the proton transfer precedes the electron transfer, and not the concerted where the proton and electron transfer occurs simultaneously.[JACS, 135, 18774, 2013] They also found that the proton transfer step needs activation barrier, in which the adsorbed $\ce{OH-}$ group is formed from the adsorbed H2O; the subsequent electron transfer to form the surface $\ce{OH^{.}}$ is barrierless. This explains well the experimentally-observed pH dependence of the OER rate, as the proton transfer need not to occur in the $\ce{OH-}$-rich basic solution.

* One important issue in the theoretical study in the photocatalysis is the choice of the DFT method; it is widely known that the standard local or semilocal DFT functionals are unable to capture the polaronic character of the surface hole.[Science, 321, 792, 2008]
* The self-interaction error is considered as the main source of this error, and when LDA or GGA functionals are applied for TiO2 systems, the excess electrons (recognized as the spin density) tend to spread over all Ti atoms.[47] This contradicts with the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiments, in which $\ce{Ti3+}$ atom is definitely observed.[42]
* To avoid this, either DFT+U method or the hybrid functional approach is often used in theoretical calculations when hole-state is involved.[JPCLett, 2, 2223, 2011]

#### WO3
* In WO3, the HER might not be sufficient due to its relatively low conduction band level, while the OER may occur considering the band structure.

### From CHEMKIN manual
* On the surface sites, we can describe the chemical state in terms of an array of surface species site fractions, $Z_k$.
* The site fractions on each site are normalized, such that
$$
\sum_{k}^K Z_k = 1
$$
* The surface molar concentration os species is then
$$
[X_k] = Z_k \frac{\Gamma}{\sigma_k}
$$
where $\Gamma$ is the density of sites ($mole\cdot cm^{-2}$) and $\sigma_k$ is the number of sites that each species $k$ occupies.

* Consider elementary reversible reactions involving $K$ chemical species that can be represented in the general form
$$
\sum_{k}^K \nu_{k_i}'x \chi_k \leftrightarrows \sum_{k}^K \nu_{k_i}''\chi_k\hspace{5mm}(i=1 \cdots I)
$$
* The stoichiometric coefficients $\nu_{k_i}$ are integer numbers and $\chi_k$ is the chemical symbol for the $k$-th species. The superscript (') indicates forward coefficient while '' indicates the reverse ones.
* The production rate of the $k$-th species, $\hat{\omega_k}$, can be written as a summation of the rate-of-progress variables for all reactions involving the $k$-th species.
$$
\hat{\omega_k} = \sum_{i}^I \nu_{k_i}q_i\hspace{5mm}(k=1\cdots N)
$$
where
$$
\nu_{k_i} = \nu_{k_i}'' - \nu_{k_i}'
$$
* The rate of progress variable for the $i$-th reaction, $q_i$, is given by the difference of the forward and reverse rates as
$$
q_i = k_{f_i}\prod_k[X_k]^{\nu_{k_i}'} - k_{r_i}\prod[X_k]^{\nu_{k_i}''}
$$
where $[X_k]$ is the molar concentration of the $k$-th species and $k_{f_i}$ and $k_{r_i}$ are the forward and reverse rate constants of the $i$-th reaction.

* In thermal systems, the reverse rate constants $k_{r_i}$ are related to the forward rate constants $k_{f_i}$ through the equilibrium constants by
$$
k_{r_i} = \frac{k_{f_i}}{K_{c_i}}
$$
* Although $K_{c_i}$ is given in concentration units, the equilibrium constants are more easily determined from the thermodynamics properties in pressure units; they are related by
$$
K_{c_i} = K_{p_i}\left(\frac{p}{RT}\right)^{\sum_k^K \nu_{k_i}}
$$
* The equilibrium constants $K_{p_i}$ are obtained from the relationship
$$
K_{p_i} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta G_i^{\rm o}}{RT}\right) = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta S_i^{\rm o}}{T} - \frac{\Delta H_i^{\rm o}}{RT}\right)
$$

* For surface reactions, the net production rate $\dot{s_k}$ is in units of $mole cm^{-2} sec^{-1}$ for each of the $K$ species,. The net production rate for each species is the sum of the rate-of-production for all reactions involving the $k$-th species, as
$$
\dot{s_k} = \sum_i \nu_{k_i} q_i
$$
* Again, the rate-of-progress variable $q_i$ is given by the difference of the forward rates and the reverse rates.
* The form of the concentrations $[X_k]$ depends upon whether species $k$ is in the gas-phase or on the surface.

* In deriving the equilibrium constant in concentration units, the surface state as well as the gas-state must be taken into account. For surface reactions, $K_{c_i}$ takes the form
$$
K_{c_i} = \left(\frac{p}{RT}\right)^{\sum_k^K \nu_{k_i}}\left(\Gamma^{\rm o}\right)^{\sum_k^K \nu_{k_i}}\prod_k \sigma^{-nu_{k_i}}\cdot K_{p_i}
$$
$\Gamma^{\rm o}$ denotes the standard-state surface site density. The sum in the first exponent runs only over the gas-phase species, and the sum in the second exponent runs only over surface species.

* For some simple surface reaction mechanisms, we have found it convenient to specify the surface reaction rate constant in terms of *sticking coefficient* or *sticking probability*, rather than an actual reaction rate.
* Conversion of a sticking coefficients $\gamma_i$ to the usual mass-action kinetic rate constants uses the collision frequency of the gas species with solid surface, as
$$
k_{f_i} = \gamma_i\frac{\prod_i \sigma_j^{\nu_{ij}'}}{(\Gamma_{tot})^m}\sqrt{\frac{RT}{2\pi W_k}}
$$
* Here, $W_k$ is teh molecular weight of the gas-phase species, $\Gamma_{tot}$ is the total surface site concentration summed over all surface phases (nume of moles of surface sites per unit area), and $m$ is the sum of all stoichiometric coefficients of reactions that are surface species.
* The term involving $\Gamma_{tot}$ raise to the $m$ power is needed to convert from the unitless sticking coefficient from to units appropriate for a rate constant, and the term in the square root accounts for the gas/surface collision frequency. Here, $\sigma_j$ is the number os sites for that species occupies, and $\nu_j$ is the reaction order for that species. The product term ($\prod \sigma_j \nu_{ij}$) will be equal to one when there are unity site occupancies for all of the surface species in the reaction.

* Surface reactions are often described using global reactions rather than as a series of elementary reactions. Some of the most common global rate expressions used for surface reactions are the Langmuir-Hinshelwood (LH) and Eley-Rideal (ER) rate expressions.
* The former applies to the case where adsorption and desorption are assumed to be in equilibrium, and a reaction on the surface between adsorbed species is rate determining.
* The latter applies to the case of a reaction between a gas-phase species and an adsorbed species being rate-limiting.

* In solving chemically reacting-flow problems, chemical production and destruction is often balanced by transport due to convection, diffusion, or conduction. In some cases, such as perfectly stirred reactors or plug-flow reactors, the determination of composition and temperature fields are assumed to be kinetically limited. In such cases, transport is assumed to be infinitely fast within the section of gas considered and the effects of transport properties can be neglected. In many other important cases, however, transport of species and energy can become rate limiting.

* For a 0-D homogeneous system, the molar production of species per unit volume, $P_k$, is given by
$$
p_i = \dot{\omega_k} + \sum_m\frac{A_m}{V}\dot{s_{k,m}} = \sum_{i=1}^I \nu_{k_i}q_i + \sum_{m=1}\frac{A_m}{V}\sum_{i=1}^{I_S}\nu_{k_i}^S q_i^S
$$
where the first and second terms of the right-hand side corresponds to the gas and surface contributions, respectively.
* Here, $\nu_{k_i}$ and $\nu_{k_k}^S$ are the (net?) stoichiometric coefficients of the gas and surface reaction, respectively, and $q_i$ and $q_i^S$ are the rate-of-progress of the gas-phase and surface reactions.
* The $A_m/V$ term accounts for the surface-to-volume ratio, and it is needed to adjust the unit between area-based reaction rate to the volume-based reaction rate.

* Sensitivity analysis of a problem solution allows quantitative understanding of how the solution depends on the various parameters contained in a model.

* The system of ordinary differential equations described for the reactor models is generally stiff, which means that there is a large disparity in time scales for evolution of different species in the reactor system. Such systems are most efficiently solved by implicit techniques for time integration.

* Principle component analysis (PCA) employs an eigenvalue-eigenvector analysis to extract kinetic information from linear sensitivities calculated for species of a reacting system.
* It studies the effect on the calculated behavior of a reaction mechanism brought about by a variation in the rate coefficients.
* The effect is most sensitive to changes in the rate coefficients along teh principle axis that corresponds to the largest eigenvalue of the sensitivity matrix and is least sensitive to changes along the axis that corresponds to the smallest eigenvalue.
* Therefore, teh reactions in the principle components with small eigenvalues can be cropped.
