<h1 id="heterogeneous-catalysts">7. Heterogeneous Catalysts</h1>
<ul>
<li>Heterogeneous catalysts have the desirable property that after
reaction they are easily separated from the reactants and products. This
is an important reason why heterogeneous catalysts are often preferred
in industry, in particular for high-volume products, for instance, in
the energy sector.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ammonia-synthesis">7-1. Ammonia synthesis</h2>
<h4 id="general">General</h4>
<ul>
<li>Ammonia (NH3) has attracted considerable attention as a hydrogen
(H2) energy carrier for several reasons. First, NH3 is much easier to
liquefy and transport than H2 gas. Second, NH3 has a higher volumetric
H2 density (120.3 kg-H2 m^-3) than those of liquid H2 (70.9 kg-H2 m^-3)
or toluene/methylcyclohexane (47.1 kg-H2 m^-3), which is also considered
as a potential hydrogen energy carrier.[Wijayanta, Int.J.Hydrogen.En,
2019]</li>
<li>NH3 is most widely produced by the Haber-Bosch process. The
Haber-Bosch process requires harsh reaction conditions and consumes
large amounts of energy.</li>
<li>Alternative reaction process or better catalysts are desirable.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="catalysts">Catalysts</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>In the Haber-Bosch process, so-called <em>doubly-promoted iron
catalyst</em> (Fe-Al2O3-K2O) discovered by Mittasch et al, in 1910 is
used.[Mittasch, “Advan.Catalysis”, vol2, 81, 1950; Frankenburg,
“Catalysis”, vol3, 171, 1955]</p></li>
<li><p>More recently, Aika et al. have found that the Ru catal[yst have
excellent activity on the NH3 synthesis over the various transition
metal elements.[BullChemSocJpn, 44, 3216, 1971; ChemLett, 161,
1973]</p></li>
<li><p>Other than Fe or Ru catalyst, transition metals such as Os, Re,
Mo, Co and Ni were reported to be promoted by addition of alkali
metal.[BullChemSocJpn, 44, 3216, 1971] It is to be noted that the above
metals themselves are known to be active elements.[Mittasch,
“Advan.Catalysis”, vol2, 81, 1950] Rh, Ir, Pd and Pt are known to have
no ability for nitrogen chemisorption[ProcRoySoc, S218, 566, 1953] and
very little or no activity for ammonia synthesis.[Frankenburg,
“Catalysis”, vol3, 234, 1955] Pt has been reported to catalyst NH3
synthesis at very high temperature and pressure.[Zeit.Electrochem, 13,
521, 1907; Jost, ibid, 14, 373, 1908] Rh, Ir, and Pd are known to
catalyst ammonia decomposition at high temperature,[Bond, “Catalysis by
Metals”, 378, 1962], while never reported to catalyst ammonia
synthesis.</p></li>
<li><p>Nowadays, the Cs-promoted Ru catalysts supported on MgO
(Cs-Ru/MgO) is considered to be one of the second-generation catalysts
for large-scale NH3 synthesis.</p></li>
<li><p>Kellog advanced ammonia process (KAPP)</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="reaction-mechanism">Reaction mechanism</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>N2 is an extremely stable molecule, owing to its N-N triple bond.
To break this bond, energy cost amounts for 9.7 eV, thus gas-phase NH3
synthesis is only possible at extremely high temperatures such as in
lightning or in electrical arcs.</p></li>
<li><p>The role of catalyst surface is to provide stabilization of the N
atoms during or after dissociation of N2.</p></li>
<li><p>In the present of a Ru catalyst, activation energy is usually
larger than 1.0 eV, thus NH3 can be formed at much more moderate
temperatures.</p></li>
<li><p>The potash promoter gives rise to a drastic change in the main
adsorbed species over iron during the course of NH3 synthesis, from N
atom over pure Fe or Al2O3-promoted Fe to imino group over the doubly
promoted iron, thus enhancing the rate of NH3 synthesis.[JCatal, 13,
232, 1969; JCatal, 19, 350, 1970]</p></li>
<li><p>Another effect of the potash promoter is enhancement of the rate
of isotopic mixing in nitrogen over irion in the presence of
hydrogen.[JCatal, 12, 145, 1968]</p></li>
<li><p>These effects on the potash promoter have benn interpreted on the
basis of its electron-donating nature.</p></li>
<li><p>One of the pioneering work on the Ru-based NH3 synthesis from
theoretical approach is that done by Honkala et al.[Science, 307, 555,
2005]</p></li>
<li><p>To estimate the fraction of B_5 sites as a function of particle
size, they calculated the surface energy of all the low-energy facets of
Ru and used them in a Wulff construction to give the basic particle
shape.</p></li>
<li><p>From DFT calculations, they found that the (001)/(101) edges
lower their energy by a reconstruction, in which the edge row of atoms
is removed. This process give rise to the steps that contain B_5 sites
along the edge.</p></li>
<li><p>Their estimate of the particle morphology is in agreement with
the TEM-observed image.</p></li>
<li><p>The lack of active sites on the small Ru particles is in full
agreement with an experimental observation.</p></li>
<li><p>The dissociative adsorption of N2 on catalyst surface is widely
considered as the rate-determining step, both on Fe and Ru.</p></li>
<li><p>Ertl et al., studied the N2 adsorption on clean Fe(100), Fe(111),
and Fe(110) with various experimental methods such as Auger electron
spectroscopy (AES), low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), ultraviolet
photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), thermal-desorption spectroscopy (TDS),
and work-function measurements. They identified (i) the dissociative
adsorption of N2 on Fe occurs via Ea of 2.2 ~ 2.5 eV, and (ii) surface
nitrides with about 2 atomic layers are formed on the Fe
surface.[JCatal, 449, 18, 1977; JCatal, 50, 519, 1977]</p></li>
<li><p>Ertl et al. performed the isotopic exchange reaction (<span
class="math inline">\ce{^{14}N^{14}N + ^{15}N^{15}N &lt;=&gt; 2
^{14}N^{15}N}</span>) on R, and have shown that the dissociation of N2
is indeed a slow and activated process.[]</p></li>
<li><p>The sticking coefficient for the dissociative adsorption is very

<li><p>However, if the whole catalytic surface were in this state, then
the resulting rate of N2 dissociation would be several orders of
magnitude lower than the observed rate of NH3 formation. Hence, they
concluded that only a small fraction of the total Ru metal surface area
of Ru/MgO seemed to be highly active, dominating the rate of NH3
formation.[CatalLett, 36, 229, 1996; JCatal, 165, 33, 1997]</p></li>
<li><p>Using surface science techniques, Ertl and co-workers studied NH3

<li><p>Based on the work from Ertl and co-workers, the group of Bowker
el al.[ApplCatal, 14, 101, 1985; SurfSci, 197, L223, 1988] and Stoltze
and Norskov [PRL, 55, 2502, 1985; J.Vac.Sci.Tech, A 5, 581, 1987;
SurfSci, 197, L230, 1988; JCatal, 110, 1, 1988; TopCatal, 1, 253, 1994]
constructed microkinetic models for Nh3 synthesis.</p></li>
<li><p>They could show that the kinetic expressions with parameters
taken from the single crystal surfaces under UHV conditions could
describe the high-pressure kinetics. Thus, in other words, it bridges a
pressure cap of about 10 to 12 orders of magnitude.</p></li>
<li><p>The concept of special “active sites” associated with
low-coordinated surface atoms was introduced as early as 1925 by
Taylor.[Proc.R.Soc.London Ser, A, 108, 105, 1925]</p></li>
<li><p>It was observed directly by using the scanning tunneling
microscope (STM) that NO preferentially dissociates at steps on a
Ru(0001) surface.[Science, 273, 1688, 1996]</p></li>
<li><p>For the H2/Si(100) system, experiments and DFT calculations have
shown that the steps dominate the reactivity.[PRL, 81, 5596,
1998]</p></li>
<li><p>Measurements of the N2 dissociation rate over Ru catalysts show a
process with an activation barrier between 0.3 and 0.6 eV.[CatalLett,
36, 229, 1996; JCatal, 165, 33, 1997]</p></li>
<li><p>However, DFT calculations have shown a dissociation barrier of
1.4 eV or even higher barrier.[9, 10]</p></li>
<li><p>STM study by Behm et al.[SurfSci, 251/252, 592, 1991; PRL, 67,
3279, 1991] have shown that the small amounts of Au deposited on a
Ru(0001) surface will preferentially decorate the steps. Based on this
fact, Dahl et al deposited Au (less than 1% of a monolayer) on Ru(0001)
and demonstrated that the Au deposition suppresses the nitrogen coverage
and thus the N2 dissociation rate substantially (FigX for Arrhenius
plot).[PRL, 83, 1814, 1999]</p></li>
<li><p>From this result, they concluded that the N2 dissociation was
dominated by step sites but these are blocked by Au deposition.</p></li>
<li><p>They also performed the DFT calculation for the N2 dissociation
over the terrace and step sites of Ru(0001) surface. The calculated
activation barrier was 1.9 eV on the terrace site, but it significantly
reduced to 0.4 eV on the step site. This is in good agreement with the
experimentally-measured value, thus their combined
experimental-theoretical work have beautifully shown that the N2
dissociation on Ru surface take place on the stepped sites.</p></li>
<li><p>Up to here, we assumed that the first step of the NH3 formation
is the N2 dissociation into N atoms; this route is called as the
dissociative mechanism. However, another possibility i.e. the
associative mechanism is possible, in which the H-addition to N2 occurs
before the N-N bond dissociation.</p></li>
<li><p>The DFT study by Garden et al focused on the role of the
associative mechanism in the NH3 synthesis reaction on a stepped
Ru(0001) surface. They concluded that, at industrial conditions, the
dissociative mechanism should be the dominant pathway however there may
be a small contribution from the associative mechanism.[J. Phys. Chem. C
2015, 119, 26554]</p></li>
<li><p>Based on their study, considering both the dissociative and
associative mechanism is important in the NH3 synthesis reaction at
conditions that is not conventional i.e. high-temperature, high-pressure
at B5 site.</p></li>

<li><p>Several metals such as Ni, Co, Ru, and Fe, have been found to be
active in the FT reaction. Of these elements, Fe and Co are most common

<li><p>Co-based catalysts are preferred over Fe-based ones owing to the

<li><p>There is considerable debate about the reaction mechanism of the

<li><p>The FT reaction is the a surface polymerization reaction. In such

</ul>
<h4 id="c-c-bond-formation">C-C bond formation</h4>
<ul>
<li>On metal surface terraces, chain growth by recombination of a
CH3,ads species with growing alkyl chains has a barrier higher than 200
kJ/mol. This agrees with early extended Huckel method results by Zheng
et al.[105], which explained this by the umbrella effect arising when
two parallel adsorbed CH3 species become close to each other on a
surface. This spatially extended CH bonds then make the first contact,
which leads to a repulsive interaction and inhibits the formation of the
C-C bonds.</li>
<li>The recombination of CHx species with x &lt; 3 with a glowing
hydrocarbon chain is substantially more favorable because then the
umbrella repulsion effect is reduced and other partially occupied
orbitals on the CHx species are available to stabilize the activation
energy. The Ea values are calculated.[14]</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="co-activation">CO activation</h4>
<ul>
<li>On the terraces on Ru or Co, the activation energies of the CO bond
cleavage can be in excess of 200 kJ/mol, while activation on step-edge
sites may reduce activation energies by 100 kJ/mol ore more.</li>
<li>On the terraces and surfaces on which direct CO activation has a
high activation barrier, a different C-O bond cleavage mechanism may
occurs. The C-O bond cleavage through intermediate hydrogen activation
of CO and intermediate formyl formation may becomes more
favorable.[29-33] On most surfaces, this reduces the overall activation
energy to convert CO to CH_x, to approximately 120 kJ/mol. This value
appears to be rather insensitive to the surface of the metal.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="microkinetics">microkinetics</h4>
<ul>
<li>A classical observation on the product distribution of the FT

logarithmically on its chain length. The slope of this relation defines
the chain growth probability <span class="math inline">\alpha</span>
that is independent of hydrocarbon chain length. This is called the

<li><p>Methane catalytic cracking is one of the several approaches to
generate CO-free hydrogen.</p></li>
<li><p>Methane cracking has the advantage over the conventional steam
reforming process by separating the carbon, which eliminates any cross
contamination of the products with COx and reduces the evolution of
greenhouse gases.[Int.J.Hyd.En, 35, 12268, 2010; Int.J.Hyd.En, 35, 9801,

<li><p>Methane decomposition without a catalyst requires very high

<li><p>A major problem encountered with methane cracking is rapid
catalyst deactivation. Catalyst deactivation occurs as carbon
accumulates on the catalyst, with carbon of course being one of the
reaction products.[Int.J.Hyd.En., 35, 12268, 2010; Int.J.Hyd.En., 30,

<h3 id="methane-conversion-general">Methane conversion (general)</h3>

<li><p>Methane (CH4) is the main component of natural gas (~ 95%), and
shale gas (typically &gt; 70%), thus a ubiquitous carbon resource in

<li><p>This molecule is quite unreactive due to its C-H bond (439

<li><p>The activation barrier for the C-H dissociation in gas-phase

<li><p>The methane conversion can be grouped into indirect

<li><p>Indirect transformation includes the conversion of methane to

<h3 id="steam-reforming-of-methane">Steam reforming of methane</h3>
<ul>
<li>Synthesis gas (syngas), the mixture of CO and H2, is an important
feedstock to produce liquid hydrocarbons and other useful organic

<li>Syngas is most commonly formed by the steam methane reforming (SMR)
reaction, which is <span class="math display">
\ce{CH4 + H2O &lt;=&gt; CO + 3H2}
</span></li>
<li>Actually, the SMR is the main consumption route for CH4 from natural
gas nowadays.</li>
<li>In a typical industrial reformer, the SMR reaction is carried out at
800-1000 <span class="math inline">^oC</span> and 14-20 atm, with a
H2O/CH4 ratio of ~2.5.[Concepts in Symgas Manufacture, 2011;
IndEngChemRes, 53, 16948, 2014; Cata.Rev, 58, 1, 2016]</li>
<li>For SMR, Ni-based catalysts are preferred in commercial units,
although precious metals such as Rh, Ru, Pd, and Pt also display high
activity.[Adv.Catal, 102, 65, 2002; JCatal, 144, 40, 1993;

3275, 2009, JCatal, 259, 147, 2008]</li>
<li>Unfortunately, the efficiency of industrial SMR over Ni is severely
hindered by carbon deposition, which leads to encapsulation or even
destricution of the Ni catalyst particles.[Catal.Today, 111, 103, 2006;
JCatal, 209, 365, 2002]</li>
<li>There is significant interest in catalysts that inhibit carbon
deposition yet retain activity to the SMR.</li>
<li>Seveal alternative reactions have been proposed, such as methane dry
reforming and partial oxidation. However, these methods yields H2/CO
ratio lower than the SMR, which is undesirable for applications such as
fuel cell that require high-purity H2.[IntJ.HydrogenEne, 37, 10444,

<h4 id="reaction-mechanism-1">Reaction mechanism</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Early works on the kinetics of Ni-catalyzed SMR focus on the
development of the rate law for the CH4 consumption.[Kinet.Catal, 5,
614, 1964; Kinet.Catal, 12, 367, 1971]</p></li>
<li><p>However, these studies provided few details about the reaction
mechanism.</p></li>
<li><p>Aparicio presented the microkinetic modeling.[JCatal, 165, 262,

<li><p>Chen et al also conducted the microkinetic modeling.[ChemEngSci,
56, 1371, 2001]</p></li>
<li><p>The activation of CH4 occurs on the metal surface, which
generates adsorbed CH3 and H fragments.</p></li>
<li><p>For the CO formation step, and important question is whether a
HCO intermediate is involved or not.[15, 20]</p></li>
<li><p>There are three potential pathways to produce CO from CH* namely
(i) recombination of adsorbed C* and O* fragments after initial C-H bond
cleavage, (ii) reaction of the CH_ads surface intermediate with adsorbed
O* to give a HCO intermediate toward CO, and (iii) the formation of a
COH intermediate.</p></li>
<li><p>Besides the CH4 activation and CO recombination, a third
important pathway in SMR is water activation to provide the necessary
O-containing surface intermediates to remove carbon from the surface. To
produce CO, the adsorbed CHx fragments have to react with O* resulting
from dissociative water adsorption.</p></li>
<li><p>The direct and O<em>-assisted water dissociation mechanism is
possible. The latter generates the OH</em> species.</p></li>
<li><p>Using the DFT-based microkinetics, Zhu et al. have compared the
reactivity of SMR on Pt(111), Pt(210), Pt(533), Rh(111), and Rh(211)
surfaces.[JCatal, 297, 227, 2013] They have found that (i) dissociative
adsorption of CH4 is the rate-determining step on Rh and Pt, and (ii) Rh
is more active than Pt due to a lower barrier for CH4 activation which
is consistent with the stronger metal-carbon bond strength of Rh, (iii)
low-coordinated Rh surface atoms are the active sites for the CH4
dissociative adsorption, and (iv) step-edge sites are required for CO
formation with low barrier.</p></li>
<li><p>The metal-support interaction and its role in the reaction
mechanism is also important topic nowadays.</p></li>
<li><p>For example, Salcedo et al. have carried out a combined
experimental-theoretical work on Ni-impregnated CeO2 catalyst
system.[ACS Catal, 11, 8327, 2021] The work has shown that the
metal-support interaction of Ni/CeO2(111) play favorable role in the
SMR; their ambient-pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (AP-XPS)
revealed that OH, CHx, and CHxO species are formed at low-temperature
such as 300 K.</p></li>
<li><p>They conducted the DFT calculation, and have shown that the
OH-assisted CO formation through the COH intermediate undergoes with
relatively low activation barrier. This pathway has some role in
preventing carbon accumulation on Ni, thus is favorable.</p></li>

<h3 id="dry-reforming-of-methane">Dry reforming of methane</h3>
<ul>
<li>The dry reforming of methane (DRM) generates the syngas (H2/CO) from
CH4 and CO2, without using H2O.[IntJHydroEn, 35, 1630; IntJHydroEn, 34,
9711; CatalToday, 141, 385]</li>
<li>The reaction is written as follows: <span class="math display">
\begin{align*}
&amp;\ce{CH4 + CO2 &lt;=&gt; 2CO + 2H2}
&amp;\hspace{5mm}&amp;(\text{DRM})\\
&amp;\ce{CH4 + H2O &lt;=&gt; CO +

C(s)}      &amp;\hspace{5mm}&amp;(\text{Boudouard reaction})
&amp;\end{align*}
</span></li>
<li>The dry reforming of methane (DRM) is an environmentally friendly
reaction because it consumes two greenhouse gases, CH4 and CO2. Another
advantage of the DRM is related to the composition of the syngas
produced; the syngas from the DRM has lower H2/CO ratio, compared with
that produced by other methods, such as coal or steam reforming of
methane (SRM).[JCatal, 259, 211] This is advantageous in producing the
long-chain alkanes by the Fisher-Tropsch synthesis.[CatalToday, 100,151,
IntJHydroEn, 35, 12821]</li>
<li>The biggest, and inevitable problem in the study of the DRM is that
it will be affected by many side reactions, such as SRM, reverse water
gas shift reaction (RWGS), methane cracking , and the Boudouard
reaction.[JCatal, 343, 196; IntJEnergyRes, 39, 119615,16] This is
because the DRM is unavoidably accompanied by the formation of H2O and
carbon deposits, which significantly affect the side reactions during
the DRM.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="catalyst-materials">Catalyst materials</h4>
<ul>
<li>The most attractive catalyst for DRM might be the supported Ni
catalyst, because of its relatively high activity and low cost.</li>
<li>However, carbon deposition is a severe problem under the reforming

<li>To improve the stability of the catalyst and thus the economic
efficiency of the DRM process, it is of vital importance to explore the
reaction mechanism under realistic conditions.</li>
<li>Identification of the RDS is of great importance in DRM.</li>
<li>Following steps are proposed as the RDS: CHxOH

<ul>
<li><p>The DFT-based microkinetics on the DRM over Ni is investigated by
Wang et al.[JCatal, 311, 469, 2014] They included 8 elementary
reactions, and have identified that Ni(111) has higher overall reaction
rate on the DRM, than that on Ni(211). From the calculated surface
coverage, they suggested that the carbon deposition more occurs on
Ni(211) than on Ni(111), therefore the Ni flat surface is favorable both

<li><p>They considered three low-index facets, namely, Ni(111), Ni(100),
and Ni(211).</p></li>
<li><p>They found that mainly three pathways contribute to the overall
reaction, and the dominant pathway is the successive CH4 dehydrogenation
which leads the surface carbon species (C<em>). The rate-determining

<h3 id="oxidative-coupling-of-methane">Oxidative coupling of
methane</h3>
<ul>
<li>In the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM), CH4 is partially
oxidized to C2 hydrocarbons such as ethane (C2H6) and ethylene (C2H4),
as opposed to the complete oxidization (or combustion) that leads CO2.
This reaction is a long-standing challenge in the field of
catalysis.</li>
<li>The OCM for generating ethane is expressed as <span
class="math display">
\ce{2CH4 + 1/2O2 -&gt; C2H6 + H2O}
</span> and subsequent dehydrogenation of ethane to ethyele occurs
simultaneously <span class="math display">
\ce{C2H6 + 1/2O2 -&gt; C2H4 + H2O}
</span></li>
<li>Successful OCM is difficult because the C2 hydrocarbon products are
more reactive than CH4, and readily undergo non-selective oxidation to
COx.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="catalyst-materials-1">Catalyst materials</h4>
<ul>
<li>Historically, the OCM reaction is first discovered by Keller and
Bhasin in 1982.[Keller, JCatal, 1982] They found that a series of metal
oxide (Sn, Pb, Sb, Mi, Tl, Cd, Mn) are active in the C2 formation from
CH4 in the presence of O2. Later, Ito and Lunsford found the Li-doped
MgO is highly effective in the OCM reaction as it gives 38% conversion
and 50% selectivity to C2.[JACS 1985]</li>
<li>Since then, a lot of effort has been devoted to find a better
catalyst.</li>
<li>However, none of the OCM catalysts developed so far have met the
industrial requirements for selectivity and conversion, i.e. ~80%
ethylene selectivity at &gt;20% CH4 conversion.[Farrell, ACS Catal.,
2016, 6, 4340]</li>
<li>Not only the Li-doped MgO, La2O3 is considered to be active
catalyst.[Ref]</li>
<li>Currently, one of the best OCM catalyst is Mn-Na2WO4/SiO2.[Li,
JCatal, 2003; Elkins, App.Catal.A, 2015]</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="reaction-mechanism-3">Reaction mechanism</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>To provide the better understanding on this difficult reaction, a
lot of theoretical works were carried out.</p></li>
<li><p>The OCM is sometimes called “homogeneous-heterogeneous reaction”,
because not only the surface-mediated reaction but also gas-phase
reaction play important role there.</p></li>
<li><p>It is widely accepted that (i) <span
class="math inline">\ce{CH3\cdot}</span> is generated from CH4 by the
C-H bond dissociation, which mainly occurs by the surface-mediated
reactions, and (ii) C2H6 formation occurs via the couping of <span
class="math inline">\ce{CH3\cdot}</span> in gas phase.[Ref] Thus both
surface- and gas-phase-reactions are important in understanding the
whole reaction mechanism.</p></li>
<li><p>Aparicio et al. carried out the microkinetic study on the OCM,
and have found that the gas-phase C2 combustion alone cannot account for
the observed C2 yield limit.[IndEngChemRes, 1991] Thus the
surface-catalyzed C2 combustion is needed to play an important role in
determining the selectivity. In this sense, the effective catalysts must
be able to produce high <span class="math inline">\ce{CH3\cdot}</span>
concentrations.</p></li>
<li><p>Alijama et al. have performed DFT-based microkinetic on the OCM
with alkaline metal oxides (MgO, CaO, and SrO) and have found that C-H
bond dissociation is not always the RDS; at weak H binding, the reaction
is limited by the C-H bond activation but at strong H-binding the
reaction is limited dur to the poisoning of the active site.[JPC.C
2017]</p></li>
<li><p>Shi et al. have proposed that the rate-limiting step is either
the formation of <span class="math inline">\ce{CH3\cdot}</span> or the
incorporation of O2 inth the catalyst.[Catal.Today, 1992]</p></li>
<li><p>The importance of the latter step i.e. the regeneration of active
sites (by incorporating O2) was also pointed out by Marin et
al.[CatalToday, 1994; IndEngChemRes, 1996] They also proposed that the
regeneration accompanies the formation and desorption of H2O
molecule.</p></li>
<li><p>The same conclusion is also drawn by Shinev et al.; on the
Mn-containing mixed oxides, the water evolution is the RDS.[CatalToday,
1994]</p></li>
<li><p>Sun and Marin have performed the microkinetic study on the
Li-doped MgO with 39 elementary reactions. They have found that
properties such as chemisorption enthalpies, initial sticking
probabilities, Eley-Rideal reaction enthalpy, or active site density
play important role (thus are “catalyst descriptor”) in determining the
OCM performance.[CatalToday, 2008]</p></li>
<li><p>There is a long-term controversy on the active site of CH4
activation on the OCM catalysts, particularly on Li-doped MgO. Earlier
studies by Landford et al. have proposed that the surface O atom next to
the doped Li atom is the active site.[JACS 1985] However, the later DFT
study by Kwapien et al. have found that the activation barrier for C-H
scission at such site is quite small (<span class="math inline">12\pm6\
kJ/mol</span>) which is different from those found by experimental
studies (80-160 kJ/mol).[AngewChem, 2014] Instead, they proposed that
stepped site on MgO is the active site for CH4 activation.</p></li>
<li><p>Driscoll and Lunsford have found that, using EPR spectroscopy,
<span class="math inline">\ce{CH3\cdot}</span> is produced on the
surface and related int o the gas-phase over the MgO catalyst.[JACS
1985]</p></li>
<li><p>Takanabe et al. have proposed that the H-abstraction from CH4 is
mediated by either oxygen species on surface or by OH radicals formed
via H2O/O2 equilibration on catalytic surface.[JPC.C, 2009] They also
proposed that OCM rates and C2+ yields are higher when H2O is present
and OH-mediated pathway prevails, because of the high reactivity of OH
radicals.</p></li>

<h3 id="non-oxidative-coupling-of-methane-nocm">non-oxidative coupling
of methane (NOCM)</h3>
<ul>
<li>NOCM to form C2 hydrocarbons has been considered since the
1990s.</li>
<li>By only feeding methane continuously, Belgued et al. reported that
C2H6 and H2 were immediately produced over a commercial 6 wt % Pt/SiO2
catalyst at low temperature (250 <span
class="math inline">^oC</span>).[Nature, 352, 789, 1991] However, owing
to catalyst deactivation, both products are no longer generated after 8
min.</li>
<li>After that, several groups have reported the NOCM on
Fe/SiO2,[Science, 344, 616, 2014], PtSn/SiO2.[ACSCatal, 7, 2088,
2017]</li>
<li>Using Pt-Bi bimetallic catalysts supported on ZSM-5 zeolite, Xiao et
al. have reported the NOCM with high C2 selectivity (&gt; 90%) and
typical methane conversion of ~2%.[ACSCatal, 8, 2735, 2018] In this
bimetallic catalyst, Pt works as the real active site but Bi work as
site blocker, attenuating the catalytic activity. The addition of Bi
suppresses the over-dehydrogenation of methane which leads coke
deposits, than that on the pure Pt.[PCCP, 11, 6225, 2009] As a result,
Bi addition to Pt promotes the NOCM selectivity and extending catalyst
lifetime.</li>

<li><p>The direct conversion of methane to methanol at low temperature

<h3 id="ethylene-epoxidation---hydrocarbon-oxidation">Ethylene
epoxidation - hydrocarbon oxidation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ethylene oxide (EO) is one of the largest volume chemicals produced
by chemical industry, and currently EO is almost exclusively produced by
silver-catalyst supported on <span
class="math inline">\ce{\alpha-Al2O3}</span>.</li>
<li>EO is widely used as chemical raw materials for detergents,
polymers, and for many other purposes.</li>
<li>According to its importance, this procedure is extensively studied
both experimentally and theoretically.[1–6]</li>
<li>A main purpose of these studies was to improve catalyst’s activity
and selectivity; the selectivity of EO is 40–50% for unpromoted silver
catalyst, but it increases to more than 80% when promoters such as Cs or
Cl are used.[7–9]</li>
<li>Owing to extensive researches, much advance has been made in the
understanding of this reaction, but detailed mechanism of this reaction
is still far from complete understanding.</li>
<li>One of the main difficulties arise from the diversity of surface
oxygen species, that is, oxygen adsorbed on silver surface takes various
forms such as atomically or molecularly adsorbed oxygen, subsurface
oxygen, and silver substituting oxygen adatoms.[7],[10–12]</li>
<li>There have been long arguments on the active oxygen species for
epoxidation, that is, atomic oxygen or molecular oxygen.[1–3,13]</li>
<li>For example, Grant and Lambert[14] and Carter and Goddard[15]
thought that the atomic oxygen made by the dissociative adsorption of
gaseous O2 is the active species for the ethylene
epoxidation.[14,15]</li>
<li>On the other hand, Campbell, Ayame and other researchers[16–20] have
proposed that super-oxide (O2–) adsorbed on silver surface is the active
species for the ethylene epoxidation, because a O-O stretching
vibrational mode is observed in the IR spectrum.[16]</li>
<li>Recent experimental studies indicated that the atomic oxygen is much
more stable in the reactive condition and, therefore, should be
considered as the active species of the olefin epoxidation.</li>
<li>For example, in 2004, Lambert and coworkers investigated styrene
epoxidation reaction on the Ag(100) surface by synchrotron X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and found that the formation of the
atomic oxygen was necessary for the epoxidation.[23]</li>
<li>In addition, recent experiments have shown that the selectivity
limit (85.7%) of the molecular oxygen-based mechanism, so-called 6/7
rule, can be exceeded.[1,2]</li>
<li>These experiments strongly indicate the atomic oxygen-based
mechanism on the clean silver surface rather than the molecular oxygen-
based one.</li>
<li>However, we note that the reaction mechanism under different
reaction conditions like in the industrial operating condition is still
unclear.</li>
<li>Recent experiments strongly suggest that silver surface takes
different configuration from the clean silver surface,[3,11,24–26] and
the molecular oxygen-based mechanism cannot be ruled out for such
conditions.</li>
<li>In addition, there is a strong possibility of O2– as active species
for the reactions on step or kink surface sites or nano-sized
clusters.[27,28]</li>
<li>To determine the active oxygen species for olefin epoxidation, the
Ag surface structure in an operating condition [high temperature,
non-ultra-high vacuum (UHV)] needs to be understood. This is because the
Ag surface reconstruction occurs in the presence of O adatoms, thus the
active phase may be different from the clean Ag surface.</li>
<li>This issue is extensively studied both experimentally and
theoretically, and it is widely known that the Ag-O surface structure
strongly depends on the oxygen coverage.[24]</li>
<li>On high-coverage surface, Rovida et al.[29] reported the formation
of the p(4 3 4) low-energy electron diffraction pattern for O/Ag(111)
system.</li>
<li>Afterward, Campbell[30] and Bare et al.[31] suggested that the
topmost Ag layer exists between two oxygen layers. Their “three-layer
model” was corrected by Carlisle et al.[32] based on the scanning
tunneling microscope (STM) experiment.</li>
<li>Furthermore, the “(p-T) phase diagram” obtained by the density
functional theory (DFT) calculations also supports the stability of
their “Ag1.83O layer model” under an operating condition for ethylene
epoxidation.[32,33]</li>
<li>In contrast to the high-oxygen coverage surfaces, the low-coverage
surfaces are less understood, although researchers admit that the
surface geometry is close to the clean Ag(111) with low-oxygen adatom
concentration.[34]</li>
<li>Interestingly, this low-coverage surface is also stable surface in
high-temperature condition, as shown from the (p-T) phase diagram given
by Scheffler and co-workers.[35]</li>
<li>Therefore, as proposed by many researchers,[24,35] it is natural to
think that high- and low-coverage surfaces may coexist in an operating
condition, that is, the real active phase in olefin epoxidation is not
yet fully determined.</li>
<li>Clearly, the difficulty is related to the limitation in STM
technique; it is not easy to have atomic resolution routinely, and more
importantly, ultra-cold and UHV condition is usually requited in STM
measurements.</li>
<li>One of the promising approaches for understanding active phase under
operating condition is in situ XPS.</li>
<li>Recent advances in this technique have made it possible to clarify
the nature of the atomic oxygens on a silver surface.</li>
<li>For example, Schlogl and coworkers carried out the detailed XPS
measurements on polycrystalline silver surface in the presence of O2 and
ethylene gas at reaction conditions (300–500 K and 0.07–1
millibar).[36]</li>
<li>In their spectrum, two atomic oxygen states called electrophilic
oxygen (Oelec) and nucleophilic oxygen (Onuc) were found.</li>
<li>These can be clearly distinguished in XPS because they have
different O1s core-electron binding energies (CEBEs); Oelec has 530.4
eV, whereas Onuc has 528.3 eV.[36–39]</li>
<li>Their notable finding was that the EO yield was proportional to the
peak intensity of Oelec, whereas Onuc was irrelevant to the EO
yield.</li>
<li>This indicates that Oelec is an active species for ethylene
epoxidation, although detailed information such as the adsorption sites
of Oelec and Onuc are not yet determined.</li>
<li>The adsorption site is significantly important to understand the
relationship between the surface oxygen states and the catalyst’s
activity or selectivity, which is the key information for new catalysts
design.</li>
<li>However, present experimental data are insufficient to fully
determine the adsorption sites of Oelec and Onuc on a silver surface,
although some important clues were known, as follows; there is an
experimental report that the appearance of the O1s signal with 528.4 6
0.1 eV in XPS is accompanied with the formation of the Ag(110)-(231)-O
added-row structure.[1,14,15,30],[31,37,39,40]</li>
<li>This structure is formed by the surface reconstruction of the
Ag(110). Thus, this strongly indicates that Onuc, whose O1s CEBE is
528.3 eV, corresponds to the O atom in the added-row structure.</li>
<li>The geometry of Oelec is less clear, but series of angle-resolved
XPS have clarified that these are on-surface oxygen species.[41,42]</li>
<li>Based on these experimental data, possible adsorption sites were
suggested by Schlogl and coworkers,[43] although further studies are
necessary to identify real adsorption sites.</li>

<h2 id="co2">7-3. CO2</h2>
<h3 id="intro">Intro</h3>
<ul>
<li>The reduction of the CO2 atmospheric concentration is a topical need
and a real challenge for the scientific community.</li>
<li>Nowadays, great efforts are made to eliminate or transform CO2 which
participates consistently to the greenhouse gas emissions.</li>
<li>Two main solutions are proposed:
<ol type="1">
<li>to capture CO2 at its source and store it in the geological
subsurface where it will no longer be able to contribute to the global
warming,</li>
<li>to promote the transformation of CO2 in the presence of an adequate
catalyst at high temperature.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>CO2 is a stable molecule. The C=O bonds in CO2 molecules are quite
stable, thus large energy input (heat) must be supplied to dissociate
them.</li>
<li>The transformation of CO2 is energy-demanding when CO2 is used as a
single reactant. The reaction is thermodynamically easier if CO2 is used
as a co-reactant with other substances with a higher Gibbs free energy,
such as H2.</li>
<li>For example, in the CO2 methanation reaction <span
class="math inline">\ce{CO2 + 4H2 &lt;=&gt; CH4 + 2H2O}</span>, the
enthalpy is about <span class="math inline">\Delta H^{\rm o} = -167\
kJ/mol</span>. This reaction is reversible and exothermic.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="co2-methanation">CO2 methanation</h3>
<ul>
<li>One interesting reaction of CO2 is the CO2 methanation reaction, in
which H2 gas is used as a reagent to transform CO2 into methane.</li>
<li>CO2 methanation is considered as a carbon capture and utilization
(CCU) technology because it converts CO2 into methane, which can be used
as fuel.</li>
<li>When H2 gas is produced by the electrolysis of water, for example,
it does not involve the CO2 emission from the fossil fuels. Moreover,
the electricity of the electrolysis is supplied from the power generated
by renewable energy source such as solar or wind energy, the CO2
methanation process is definitely the negative CO2 emission technology.
Because of this, the CO2 methanation is considered as one of the key
reactions to reduce CO2 content in air.</li>
<li>The reaction formula of the CO2 methanation is given as follows:
<span class="math display">
\ce{CO2 + 4H2 -&gt; CH4 + 2H2O},\hspace{5mm}\Delta H = -165 \ {\rm
kJ/mol}
</span></li>
<li>This reaction was discovered by Sabatier and Senderens in
1902.[Ref]</li>
<li>The catalyst exhibits low activity at low temperature; thus a large
amount of heat is required for preheating the catalyst bed and feed gas.
However, the high temperature condition shifts the equilibrium to the
reactant side according to Le Chatelier’s principle. Thus catalysts
highly active at lower temperature is needed.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="catalyst-materials-2">Catalyst materials</h4>
<ul>
<li>Ni- and Ru-based catalysts are two of the most popular catalysts
employed for this transformation. Even though Ru is more active, its use
is limited by high cost and low availability, whereas Ni is cheaper but
is less active.</li>
<li>Ru and Rh catalysts are also extensively studied since they exhibit
high activity and selectivity for CH4.[11-13]</li>
<li>Tada et al. compared the performance of the CO2 methanation over
Ni/CeO2, Ni/<span class="math inline">\ce{\alpha-Al2O3}</span>, Ni/TiO2,
and Ni/MgO. They found that Ni/CeO2 has the highest CO2 conversion
especially at lower temperatures.[IntlJHydrogeEn, 37, 5527, 2012] They
proposed that the partial reduction of CeO2 surface could result in the
high CO2 conversion.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="reaction-mechanism-4">Reaction mechanism</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>The catalytic mechanism of the CO2 methanation is extensively
studied both experimentally and theoretically. One of the most debated
issue is the activation routes of CO2 and CO.</p></li>
<li><p>Researchers proposed several pathways as the direct and indirect
transformation route of CO2 and CO are possible. The direct
transformation occurs by the C-O bond dissociation, while the indirect
route undergoes the hydrogenation of CO2 and CO. The direct
transformation of CO2 to CO is quite simple as it undergoes via
surface-mediated C-O bond dissociation. In contrast, several
possibilities exist in the indirect CO2 transformation because either
the O-terminal hydrogenation or the H-terminal hydrogenation is
possible. Therefore three pathways for the CO2 activation exists, as
follows:[Fitzharris1982, Bothra2013, Vesselli2008, Peebles1983] <span
class="math display">
\begin{align*}
&amp;\ce{CO2 -&gt; CO + O}&amp; &amp;\text{CO2 direct dissociation} \\
&amp;\ce{CO2 -&gt; COOH$*$ -&gt; CO$*$}&amp; &amp;\text{carbonate
pathway} \\
&amp;\ce{CO2 -&gt; HCOO$*$ -&gt; HCO$*$ -&gt;
CO$*$}&amp;  &amp;\text{formate pathway}
\end{align*}
</span></p></li>
<li><p>Several groups concluded that either direct CO2 transformation or
the CO2 hydrogenation via HCOO* are kinetically favored over the pathway
via COOH* formation.[Huang2019, Chioresu2019] For example, Huang et
al. have analyzed the CO2 methanation on Ni(111) with the DFT, and have
found that the activation barriers of the CO2 transformation to CO*,
HCOO* and COOH* are 43, 52, and 99 kJ/mol, respectively.[Huang2019] The
same conclusion is reached by Mohan et al., who carried out the density
functional theory (DFT)-based microkinetic study; they concluded that
the CO2 direct dissociation is kinetically and thermodynamically favored
[Mohan2021].</p></li>
<li><p>The above issue of the CO2 transformation is intimately related
to the subsequent CO transformation, which is another debated issue in
the CO2 methanation.</p></li>
<li><p>Using the DFT, Ren et al. compared the methanation with and
without CO intermediate by comparing following three
pathways;[Ren2015]</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>CO2 ⟶ HCOO* ⟶ CO + OH</li>
<li>CO2 ⟶ CO* + O* ⟶ C* + O* ⟶ CH4,</li>
<li>CO2 ⟶ C(OH)2* ⟶ CH2O* + OH ⟶ CH2* ⟶ CH4.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>They concluded that the pathway 2 is most kinetically favorable,
and the rate-determining step (RDS) is the CO dissociation into C* and
O*. This agrees with the past experimental work by Fitzharris et
al.[Fitzharris1986] On the contrary, Huang et al. insisted that the CO
activation via hydrogenation is favorable; they proposed that the HCO*
formation from HCOO* is kinetically and thermodynamically more favorable
than HCO* formation from CO*.[Huang2019]</p></li>
<li><p>To conclude this issue, the extensive DFT-based microkinetic
study was carried out, and it concluded that the direct CO dissociation
on Ni(111) is favorable over the CO dissociation via the HCO formation,
where the RDS is <span class="math inline">\ce{HCO -&gt; CH +
O}</span>[Huang2019].</p></li>
<li><p>It is natural to envisage a different reaction mechanism for the
CO2 methanation on Ru from that on Ni surface, mainly because Ru is more
oxophilic than Ni; one can expect that the C-O bond cleavage more occurs
on Ru.</p></li>
<li><p>Indeed, several groups have proposed that the CO2 activation on
Ru occurs via the direct C-O dissociation.[Avanesian, JCatal, 343, 86,
2016; Schlexer, CatalLett., 147, 1871, 2017; Chiorescu, SurfSci, 2019]
On the contrary, the DFT study by Zhang insisted that the CO2
hydrogenation on Ru(0001) occurs via HCOO intermediate.[Zhang, RSCAdv,
2014]</p></li>
<li><p>Therefore the mechanism of the CO2 methanation on Ru, especially
on the CO2/CO activation is still controversial.</p></li>

<li><p>Air pollution form vehicle exhaust gas has been a serious
environmental problem, particular in urban areas. To reduce harmful
gases from car exhaust, catalytic converters are now widely used.
Typically, CO, unburnt hydrocarbons (CHx), and NOx should be
simultaneously converted into harmless gasses.</p></li>
<li><p>This is accomplished by using three-way catalysts (TWCs), which
primally consist of precious metals such as Rh, Pd, and Pt.</p></li>
<li><p>CO and CHx can be removed by oxidation, whereas NOx is removed by
reduction with CO or CHx acting as the reducing agent.</p></li>
<li><p>However, the N-O bond is strong (<span class="math inline">631.6\
kJ/mol</span>) for direct reduction of NOx by CO or CHx in gas phase.
Thus, the N-O should be activated by a metal surface. Thus the ability
to dissociate the N-O bond is a key requirement for
TWCs.[2Deushi]</p></li>
<li><p>Rh catalysts are thought to exhibit high activities toward NOx
reduction, because of their capability of facilitating NO
dissociation.</p></li>
<li><p>Experimental investigations of the NOx reduction frequently
employ a model reaction, such as the NO + CO reaction, which generates
N2 and CO2 as the product. This is considered to be a simplified system
for evaluating exhaust gas conversion by TWCs.[6-10Deushi]</p></li>
<li><p>Experimental studies have shown that, compared to other

</span> where this electrochemical reaction is facilitated by consuming
16 adenosine triphosphate (ATP) molecules.</p></li>
<li><p>Such <strong>electrochemical NH3 synthesis</strong> has following
advantages over the conventional Habor-Bosch process;</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Electrochemical NH3 synthesis can proceed under mild conditions,
thus energy consumption is reduced.[Kyriakou, Catal.Today, 2017; Cui,
Adv.Ene.Mat, 2018]</li>
<li>It opens the possiblities to use H2O as H2 source, thus one can
avoid the use of fossil fuels (i.e. <strong>green

</ol></li>
<li><p>Electrochemical NH3 synthesis using solid electrolyte has two
half reactions; at anode, <span class="math display">
\ce{H2O &lt;=&gt; 1/2O2 + 2H+ + 2e-}\\
\text{or} \\
\ce{H2 &lt;=&gt; 2H+ + 2e-}

<li><p>At cathode, <span class="math display">
\ce{N2 + 6H+ + 6e- &lt;=&gt; 2NH3}
</span></p></li>
<li><p>The net reaction is <span class="math display">

</span></p></li>
<li><p>One promising approach for electrochemical NH3 synthesis is to
use a fuel cell with a solid electrolyte. Many studies have reported
using a solid electrolyte for NH3 synthesis at the gas–solid
interface.[DOI: 10.1126/science.282.5386.98; DOI:
10.1016/j.ssi.2006.11.019; DOI: 10.1016/j.cattod.2016.09.006 ;DOI:
10.1039/B004885M]</p></li>
<li><p>This device consists of an anode, a cathode, and a solid
electrolyte.</p></li>
<li><p>Water dissociation on the anode generates protons, which are
transported to the cathode through the solid electrolyte. Then, at
cathode, protons combine with electrons and N2 to produce NH3. The NH3
formation at the cathode is known to determine the overall reaction rate
and yield, and extensive efforts have been devoted to find effective
catalysts for the cathode reaction.</p></li>
<li><p>For example, several researchers have investigated metal systems
such as Ru and Ni. Ru is well known as a suitable catalyst for the
thermal NH3 synthesis,[DOI: 10.1246/bcsj.44.3216].</p></li>
<li><p>However, its electrochemical NH3 formation rate is still low,
such as 3.0 × 10−13 mol·s−1·cm−2 on Ru/MgO, as observed by Skodra and
Stoukides.[DOI: 10.1016/j.ssi.2009.08.001]</p></li>
<li><p>To further enhance the NH3 formation rate, a detailed
understanding of the reaction mechanism is necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>Several mechanistic studies based on kinetic measurements or
theoretical calculations have been performed.[DOI:

10.1002/aenm.201800369]</p></li>
<li><p>Currently, there are two widely accepted pathways for NH3
synthesis: the dissociative mechanism (in which N–N bond dissociation
occurs first) and the associative mechanism (in which NHx (x = 1–3)
species form before N–N bond dissociation).[DOI:
10.1103/PhysRevLett.83.1814; DOI: 10.1063/1.481103; DOI:
10.1126/science.1106435; DOI: 10.1039/C5CP07363D]</p></li>
<li><p>The Haber–Bosch process is considered to occur through the
dissociative mechanism, while many researchers believe that
electrochemical NH3 synthesis occurs through an associative mechanism
because of its milder reaction conditions.[DOI: 10.1063/1.481103; DOI:
10.1039/C1CP22271F]</p></li>
<li><p>Another important mechanism is the Mars–van Krevelen mechanism,
in which lattice N atoms are used for NH3 formation.</p></li>
<li><p>Several researchers have investigated electrochemical NH3
synthesis via this mechanism using a metal nitride cathode.[DOI:
10.1016/j.cattod.2016.06.014; DOI: 10.1002/aenm.201800369; DOI:
10.1039/C4CP04838E; DOI: 10.1021/acscatal.5b01918]</p></li>
<li><p>Another key factor in the electrochemical NH3 synthesis is its
competition with the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER);[DOI:
10.1039/B004885M; DOI: 10.1038/srep01145] <span class="math display">
\ce{2H+ + 2e- &lt;=&gt; H2}
</span></p></li>
<li><p>H adsorption on the catalyst surface or active site competes with
N2 adsorption, and when a negative potential is applied, the HER becomes
easier than NH3 formation. These effects are unfavorable for the NH3
formation, because the electronic current are consumed by the HER; the
NH3 electrosynthesis has low Faradaic efficiency typically much less
than 30%.</p></li>

<li><p>They found the linear relationship between the adsorption energy
of <span class="math inline">\ce{NHx}</span> species and the N atom
adsorption energy. As seen in Chapter X, this enables the construction
of volcano plots.</p></li>
<li><p>In Fig.X, such volcano plots of four assumptions are shown; (i)
dissociative mechanism on flat surface, (ii) dissociative mechanism on
stepped surface, (iii) associative mechanism on flat surface, and (iv)
associative mechanism on stepped surface.</p></li>
<li><p>On the right legs of the volcanoes, the adsorption of N2 and
proton transfer to N2 (N2(g) + H+ + e- -&gt; N2H*) is the
rate-determining step for the associative mechanism, while on the left
legs the NH + H+ + e- -&gt; NH2 (flat) or NH2 + H+ + e- -&gt; NH3(g)
(step) are the rate-determining step. When the dissociative mechanism is
assumed, the N2 dissociation is always the rate-determining.</p></li>
<li><p>Another important point in Fig.X is that information on the
competing between HER and NH3 synthesis is included there.</p></li>
<li><p>The gray-shaded area indicates the conditions under which the
surface will be covered with H atoms, while the white area indicates for
which metals the surface will be covered with N atoms.</p></li>
<li><p>For metals at the gray-shared area, the HER more occurs than NH3
synthesis because surface is covered by H atom; because of this, metals
such as Rh, Ru, Ir are good catalyst in terms of the volcano plots but
actually the NH3 formation rate as HER more occurs. From this figure,
only the flat metal surfaces of Sc, Y, Ti and Zr are expected to have
some resistance to H poisoning, however the negative bias is needed to
drive the NH3 synthesis reaction.</p></li>
<li><p>Some catalyst systems with high N2 dissociation rates (e.g., Ru
and Ni) suffer from low NH3 formation rates because of the HER.</p></li>
<li><p>Previously, several groups analyzed the competition of the HER
and NH3 synthesis, and have shown that overcoming HER is necessary

<li><p>The first step in the CO2RR is the activation of CO2 molecule. It

analysis have found that (i) moderate CO adsorption (~ -0.67 eV) is the
key for the CO2 reduction TOF, and Cu-Al bimetallic system is favorable
catalyst from this viewpoint, and (ii) detailed configuration of the
Cu-Al cluster is important to have optimal CO adsorption, and adsorption
site with a higher Cu content than Al is desirable. Based on this
computational result, they synthesized the Cu-Al catalyst with the high

<li><p>The anode material consists of Ti plates coated with TiO2-RuO2
mixed oxides, commonly denoted as dimensionally stable anodes
(DSA).[Electrochem. Soc., 127, 303C–307C, 1980; Platinum Met. Rev., 42,
27–33, 1998; Anal.Chem., 83, 7645–7650, 2011] Among this material, RuO2
has been identified as active component of the DSA for electrochemical
chlorine evolution (CER),[Electrochim. Acta, 45, 2377–2385,
2000]</p></li>
<li><p>The CER is known to have a selectivity problem because the oxygen
evolution reaction (OER) is a competing side reaction in the same
potential window of CER.[ChemSusChem, 5, 1897, 2012; Angew. Chem. Int.
Ed., 53, 11032–11035, 2014; Electrocatalysis, 6, 198–210, 2015; J. G.
Vos, M. T. M. Koper, J. Electroanal. Chem. 2018, 819, 260–268.; JACS,
140, 10270, 2018]</p></li>
<li><p>From a thermodynamic viewpoint, the OER is preferred over the CER
because its equilibrium potential (<span class="math inline">U^0</span>)
is smaller (1.23 V) than that of the CER (1.36 V). However, in terms of
kinetics, the CER is advantageous as it is a faster two-electron process
(<span class="math inline">\ce{2Cl-(aq) -&gt; Cl2(g) + 2e-}</span>)
while the OER requires the transfer of four electrons (<span
class="math inline">\ce{2H2O(aq) -&gt; O2(g) + 4H+(aq) + 4e-}</span>).
As a result, the exchange current for the OER is low due to the kinetic
limitation, and thus the CER prevails over the OER above 1.36
V.</p></li>
<li><p>The equilibrium potential of the CER is independent of the pH. On
the other hand, the equilibrium potential of the OER is increased by
decreasing pH. Thus the selectivity can be shifted toward the CER by
keeping the low pH. This finding gives reasoning, why the chlor-alkali
process is carried out in an acidic environment, since only under these
conditions the CER predominates over the OER.[Chem. Rev., 116,
2982–3028, 2016; ACS Catal, 7, 2403, 2017]</p></li>
<li><p>Understanding the surface structure of catalysts is a starting
point for analyzing the reaction mechanism. For this purpose, several
grpus have calculated a Pourbaix diagram by the ab initio
calculation.[Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 12 (2010) 283; Electrochimica Acta
120 (2014) 460–466] The diagram reveals that oxygen bound on-top of
Ru_{cus} atoms is stable over a wide potential and pH range, in
particular for U &gt; 1.36 V where both the CER and OER take place. At
slightly higher potentials (U &lt; 1.49 V) and for pH &lt; 4, the
terminal adsorption of Cl on O_{ot} is energetically favored, therefore
this adsorbate structure can be considered as a precursor for the
CER.</p></li>
<li><p>For pH &gt; 4 and U &gt; 1.4 V, another surface structure becomes
energetically preferred. This surface structure with the OOH_{ot}
reaction intermediate surves as a precursor for the OER over RuO2(110),
while the CER cannot occur on this surface structure. Therefore, the
transition from the fully O-covered RuO2(110) surface to this surface is
indicative of the OER.</p></li>
<li><p>Their work above have clearly shown that the ab initio Pourbaix
diagram constitute the starting point for the reaction mechanism
analysis for the electrochemical reaction, as the stable surface
structure is divergent and dependent on conditions such as pH or
voltage.</p></li>
<li><p>In a first-principles kinetics study,[AngewChem, 55, 7501, 2016]
the reaction mechanism of the CER over the active RuO2(110)-O_{ot}
surface was ascribed to the pathway of
Volmer-Heyrovsky.[Electrochim.Acta, 22, 1093–1100, 1977; S. Trasatti, G.
Lodi, in: S. Trasatti, Electrodes of Conductive Metallic Oxides Anodes,
Part B, Elsevier, 1981]</p></li>
<li><p>This mechanism comprises the adsorption and discharge of a
chloride anion on the active Ru_{cus}-O_{ot} site in the Volmer step,
which is followed by the direct recombination of the adsorbed chlorine
species in the Ru_{cus}-OCl_{ot} precursor with another chloride anion
from the electrolyte solution; this step is called the Heyrovsky
step.</p></li>
<li><p>The CER over RuO2(110) requires the formation of the O_{ot} and
the OCl_{ot} adsorbate, in which either the Volmer step or the Heyrovsky
step constitutes the rate-determining step (RDS).</p></li>
<li><p>For small overpotentials, i.e. <span
class="math inline">\eta_{\rm CER} = U - U^0_{\rm CER} &lt; 0.10\
V</span>, the Heyrovsky step governs the kinetics, while the RDS
switches to the Volmer step if the applied overpotential is raised
(<span class="math inline">\eta_{\rm CER} &gt; 0.10\
V</span>).[AngewChem, 55, 7501, 2016; ACS Catal, 8, 1864– 1879,
2018]</p></li>
<li><p>Ab initio theory [J. Am. Chem. Soc., 132, 18214–18222, 2010]
identified the formation of the OOH_{ot} adsorbate as the RDS in the
OER, which was confirmed later by a combined experiment-theory
approach.[ACS Catal., 8, 1864– 1879, 2018; ChemElectroChem, 4,
2902–2908, 2017]</p></li>
<li><p>Consequently, at typical overpotential of industrial electrolysis
i.e. <span class="math inline">\eta_{\rm CER} &gt; 0.10\ V</span> (<span
class="math inline">\eta_{\rm OER} &gt; 0.23\ V@pH=0</span>), the
OCl_{ot} adsorbate and the OOH_{ot} adsorbate govern the activity of the
CER or the OER, respectively.</p></li>
<li><p>Based on this idea, it is suggested to employ the free energy
difference of the limitig OOH and OCl adsorbate i.e. <span
class="math inline">\Delta G({\rm OOH}) - \Delta G({\rm OCl})</span>, as
a measure for stability and CER selectivity, in that the spacing between
the limiting adsorbates ought to be maximized for improved performance
in the electrocatalytic CER over transition-metal-oxide-based
electrodes.</p></li>

<h3 id="che">CHE</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>To determine the potential of an electrochemical cell, the
reference electrode is necessary. The most common reference electrode is
the <strong>standard hydrogen electrode (SHE)</strong>, which is based
on the redox reaction <span class="math display">
\ce{H+(aq) + e- &lt;=&gt; \frac{1}{2} H2(g)}
</span> that occurs at a Pt electrode.</p></li>
<li><p>The concentration of <span class="math inline">\ce{H+}</span> and
H2 is maintained at unity, which implies the pressure of H2 gas is 1 bar
and the activity coefficient of <span class="math inline">\ce{H+}</span>
is unity.</p></li>
<li><p>In the theoretical simulation, an approximate version of SHE
called <strong>the computational hydrogen electrode (CHE)</strong> is
often used. Here, the chemical potential of <span
class="math inline">\ce{H+}</span> and <span
class="math inline">\ce{e-}</span> pair as one half of the chemical
potential of a H2 molecule. Thus, by evaluating the chemical potential
of H2, one can estimate the chemical potentials of <span
class="math inline">\ce{H+}</span> and <span
class="math inline">\ce{e-}</span>; this is a merit as bare protons and
electrons are difficult to treat in computational method. Using this
CHE, when the potential <span class="math inline">U_{\rm SHE}</span> is
applied (versus the SHE), <span class="math inline">\mu_{\ce{H+}}</span>
and <span class="math inline">\mu_{\ce{e-}}</span> are <span

\begin{align*}

K})
\end{align*}
</span> at some fixed pH.</p></li>
<li><p>Therefore, one can evaluate the dependence of the thermodynamic
quantities (such as the reaction Gibbs energy <span
class="math inline">\Delta G</span> of elementary reactions) on <span
class="math inline">U_{\rm SHE}</span> easily.</p></li>
<li><p>Here, we mention another common reference electrode, the
<strong>reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)</strong>. The potential of
RHE is evaluated as <span class="math display">
\begin{align*}
U_{\rm RHE}
&amp;= U_{\rm SHE} + \frac{k_BT}{e}\ln10\times pH \\
&amp;= 0.00 - 0.059\times pH (\text{at 298.15 K
})
\end{align*}
</span></p></li>
<li><p>Unlike the SHE, its measured potential <em>does</em> change with
the pH. In other words, the activity coefficient of <span
class="math inline">\ce{H+}</span> is not unity but corresponds to that
of the electrolyte solution. Because of this property, the RHE can be
directly immersed in the actual electrolyte solution. This is
practically useful than the SHE, which should be separated by a salt
bridge.</p></li>
<li><p>CHE-based models typical assume concerted <strong>proton-electron
transfer (CPET)</strong>, thus the process via <strong>sequential

<li><p>CPET is also called <strong>proton-coupled electron transfer
(PCET)</strong>.</p></li>

<h3 id="tio2">TiO2</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>In 1972, Fujishima and Honda reported the production of H2 from
photocatalytic water splitting by TiO2.[Nature. 1972, 238 (5358),
37–8]</p></li>
<li><p>This feature of TiO2 is quite advantageous in many respects, such
as solar cells or environmental clean-up; by utilizing photocatalytic
reactions, air pollutants such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs),
nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulphur oxides (SOx) can be removed.</p></li>
<li><p>This material has high catalytic activity, and has a lot of
advantages such as good stability, nontoxicity to human body, and low
cost.[Rev Adv Mater Sci. 2018, 55(1), 1–11]</p></li>
<li><p>Hence, the TiO2 is widely used in our daily life nowadays. For
this reason, it is natural that the TiO2 is one of the most extensively
studied materials in the field of photocatalysis.[Nanotechnol Rev. 2019,
8(1), 671–80]</p></li>
<li><p>The photocatalytic process consists of the following steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>photoexcitation: an electron-hole pair is generated by the
adsorption of light equal to or greater than the band gap of the
photocatalyst.</li>
<li>the electron-hole pair dissociates into a free electron and a free
hole and then migrates to the reactive surface.</li>
<li>the free electron/hole is transferred to an adsorbed molecule and
further undergoes photoreduction/photooxidation.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>TiO2 has relatively wide band gap (Eg = 3.0-3.2 eV), thus it does
not effectively absorb visible light. [Energ Env Sci. 2016, 9(2),
411–33]</p></li>
<li><p>This is one of the several reasons why the photocatalytic
activity of TiO2 nanoparticles remains low (~ 6%).</p></li>
<li><p>Three main crystal types of TiO2 have been identified in nature,
namely, brookite, rutile, and anatase.[Prog Solid State Ch.
2004;32(12):33–177] Both rutile and anatase TiO2 belong to the
tetragonal system, while brookite TiO2 belongs to the orthorhombic
system. The structure of brookite TiO2 is unstable, and its preparation
is relatively difficult.[B Korean Chem Soc. 2009;30(2):402–4; Ref]
Therefore, it is usually used for basic research and rutile and anatase
TiO2 play a major role in the field of photocatalysis
applications.</p></li>
<li><p>According to recent studies, the photocatalytic property of
rutile phase TiO2 is slightly lower than anatase phase TiO2.[Polym
Degrad Stabil. 2018;150:31–6; Phys Lett A. 2016;380(16):1462–8 ; Mater
Chem Phys. 2017, 186:333–40] In fact, the energy gap of rutile phase
(3.0 eV) is narrower than the anatase phase (3.2 eV), and the energy
required for electrons to be excited to transition is relatively small;
therefore, the light response range of rutile TiO2 is wider. However,
the rutile TiO2 tends to have a larger particle size and form an
agglomerated structure, leading to easy recombination of the
electron-hole pairs.[J Phys Chem Lett. 2017;8(22):5593–8.] Conversely,
the crystal of the anatase TiO2 has more defects and dislocations, which
increase the separation of electron-hole paris generated in this
crystal. Because of this, photocatalytic property of anatase TiO2 is
stronger than the rutile TiO2.</p></li>
<li><p>The energy band structure of semiconductor TiO2 contains a
valence band (VB), a conduction band (CB), and a region between the CB
and VB called the band gap (<span
class="math inline">E_g</span>).</p></li>
<li><p>The formula used to calculated the band gap is <span
class="math inline">E_g = E_{VB} - E_{CB}</span>, where <span
class="math inline">E_{CB}</span> corresponds to the bottom potential of
the CB, and <span class="math inline">E_{VB}</span> corresponds to the
top potential of VB.[79, 80Review]</p></li>
<li><p>When the energy of the incident photon is equal to or greater
than the <span class="math inline">E_g</span> of TiO2, the electrons in
the VB will shift to the CB, and the holes will be generated in the VB,
thus forming a photogenerated electron (<span
class="math inline">e^-</span>) and hole (<span
class="math inline">h^+</span>) pair.[Nanotechnol Rev. 2018,

<h4 id="water-splitting-1">Water splitting</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>As seen in Section X, the water splitting process consists of
thwo half-reaction i.e. the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the
anode, and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the cathode of a
(photo)electrochemical cell. Of the two, the OER is the major obstacle
as it generally requires a large overpotential. This difficulty also
exists for TiO2 anode.</p></li>
<li><p>In the photocatalytic water-splitting reaction, the adsorption
state of water molecules on the surface of TiO2 will directly affect its
catalytic activity. Therefore a lot of theoretical works have focused on
the interfacial adsorption configuration of water molecules and TiO2,
but controversies still exist regarding the adsorption morphology and
structure of water molecules.</p></li>
<li><p>The most controversial question is whether water molecules
self-dissociate or not on the TiO2 surface.[Front Phys. 2018,
13(3):138107; J Chem Eng Data. 2018, 63(7), 2420–9]</p></li>
<li><p>Currently, it is generally agreed that the oxidation of water is
initiated by the formation of surface-trapped photoholes; these holes
(<span class="math inline">\ce{h+}</span>) can oxidize water to O2
through the following four sequential proton coupled electron transfer
(PCET) steps;[JPC.C, 112, 9872, 2008] <span class="math display">
\begin{align*}
\ce{&amp; H2O$*$ + h+ &amp; &amp;-&gt; OH$*$ + H+} \\

\ce{&amp; O$*$ + H2O(l) + h+ &amp; &amp;-&gt; OOH$*$ + H+} \\
\ce{&amp; OOH$*$ + h+ &amp; &amp;-&gt; O2 + H+}
\end{align*}
</span></p></li>
<li><p>Among them, either the first or the second step is considered as
the rate-determining step of the OER.</p></li>
<li><p>DFT study by Selloni et. al have shown that the first PCET occurs
is actually a sequential PCET where the proton transfer precedes the
electron transfer, and not the concerted where the proton and electron
transfer occurs simultaneously.[JACS, 135, 18774, 2013] They also found
that the proton transfer step needs activation barrier, in which the
adsorbed <span class="math inline">\ce{OH-}</span> group is formed from
the adsorbed H2O; the subsequent electron transfer to form the surface
<span class="math inline">\ce{OH^{.}}</span> is barrierless. This
explains well the experimentally-observed pH dependence of the OER rate,
as the proton transfer need not to occur in the <span
class="math inline">\ce{OH-}</span>-rich basic solution.</p></li>
<li><p>One important issue in the theoretical study in the
photocatalysis is the choice of the DFT method; it is widely known that
the standard local or semilocal DFT functionals are unable to capture

<li><p>The self-interaction error is considered as the main source of
this error, and when LDA or GGA functionals are applied for TiO2
systems, the excess electrons (recognized as the spin density) tend to
spread over all Ti atoms.[47] This contradicts with the electron
paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiments, in which <span
class="math inline">\ce{Ti3+}</span> atom is definitely
observed.[42]</p></li>
<li><p>To avoid this, either DFT+U method or the hybrid functional
approach is often used in theoretical calculations when hole-state is
involved.[JPCLett, 2, 2223, 2011]</p></li>

<li><p>On the surface sites, we can describe the chemical state in terms
of an array of surface species site fractions, <span
class="math inline">Z_k</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>The site fractions on each site are normalized, such that <span
class="math display">
\sum_{k}^K Z_k = 1
</span></p></li>
<li><p>The surface molar concentration os species is then <span
class="math display">
[X_k] = Z_k \frac{\Gamma}{\sigma_k}
</span> where <span class="math inline">\Gamma</span> is the density of
sites (<span class="math inline">mole\cdot cm^{-2}</span>) and <span
class="math inline">\sigma_k</span> is the number of sites that each
species <span class="math inline">k</span> occupies.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider elementary reversible reactions involving <span
class="math inline">K</span> chemical species that can be represented in
the general form <span class="math display">
\sum_{k}^K \nu_{k_i}&#39;x \chi_k \leftrightarrows \sum_{k}^K
\nu_{k_i}&#39;&#39;\chi_k\hspace{5mm}(i=1 \cdots I)
</span></p></li>
<li><p>The stoichiometric coefficients <span
class="math inline">\nu_{k_i}</span> are integer numbers and <span
class="math inline">\chi_k</span> is the chemical symbol for the <span
class="math inline">k</span>-th species. The superscript (‘) indicates
forward coefficient while’’ indicates the reverse ones.</p></li>
<li><p>The production rate of the <span class="math inline">k</span>-th
species, <span class="math inline">\hat{\omega_k}</span>, can be written
as a summation of the rate-of-progress variables for all reactions
involving the <span class="math inline">k</span>-th species. <span
class="math display">
\hat{\omega_k} = \sum_{i}^I \nu_{k_i}q_i\hspace{5mm}(k=1\cdots N)
</span> where <span class="math display">
\nu_{k_i} = \nu_{k_i}&#39;&#39; - \nu_{k_i}&#39;
</span></p></li>
<li><p>The rate of progress variable for the <span
class="math inline">i</span>-th reaction, <span
class="math inline">q_i</span>, is given by the difference of the
forward and reverse rates as <span class="math display">
q_i = k_{f_i}\prod_k[X_k]^{\nu_{k_i}&#39;} -
k_{r_i}\prod[X_k]^{\nu_{k_i}&#39;&#39;}
</span> where <span class="math inline">[X_k]</span> is the molar
concentration of the <span class="math inline">k</span>-th species and
<span class="math inline">k_{f_i}</span> and <span
class="math inline">k_{r_i}</span> are the forward and reverse rate
constants of the <span class="math inline">i</span>-th
reaction.</p></li>
<li><p>In thermal systems, the reverse rate constants <span
class="math inline">k_{r_i}</span> are related to the forward rate
constants <span class="math inline">k_{f_i}</span> through the
equilibrium constants by <span class="math display">
k_{r_i} = \frac{k_{f_i}}{K_{c_i}}
</span></p></li>
<li><p>Although <span class="math inline">K_{c_i}</span> is given in
concentration units, the equilibrium constants are more easily
determined from the thermodynamics properties in pressure units; they
are related by <span class="math display">
K_{c_i} = K_{p_i}\left(\frac{p}{RT}\right)^{\sum_k^K \nu_{k_i}}
</span></p></li>
<li><p>The equilibrium constants <span
class="math inline">K_{p_i}</span> are obtained from the relationship
<span class="math display">
K_{p_i} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta G_i^{\rm o}}{RT}\right) =
\exp\left(\frac{\Delta S_i^{\rm o}}{T} - \frac{\Delta H_i^{\rm
o}}{RT}\right)
</span></p></li>
<li><p>For surface reactions, the net production rate <span
class="math inline">\dot{s_k}</span> is in units of <span
class="math inline">mole cm^{-2} sec^{-1}</span> for each of the <span
class="math inline">K</span> species,. The net production rate for each
species is the sum of the rate-of-production for all reactions involving
the <span class="math inline">k</span>-th species, as <span
class="math display">
\dot{s_k} = \sum_i \nu_{k_i} q_i
</span></p></li>
<li><p>Again, the rate-of-progress variable <span
class="math inline">q_i</span> is given by the difference of the forward
rates and the reverse rates.</p></li>
<li><p>The form of the concentrations <span
class="math inline">[X_k]</span> depends upon whether species <span
class="math inline">k</span> is in the gas-phase or on the
surface.</p></li>
<li><p>In deriving the equilibrium constant in concentration units, the
surface state as well as the gas-state must be taken into account. For
surface reactions, <span class="math inline">K_{c_i}</span> takes the
form <span class="math display">
K_{c_i} = \left(\frac{p}{RT}\right)^{\sum_k^K
\nu_{k_i}}\left(\Gamma^{\rm o}\right)^{\sum_k^K \nu_{k_i}}\prod_k
\sigma^{-nu_{k_i}}\cdot K_{p_i}
</span> <span class="math inline">\Gamma^{\rm o}</span> denotes the
standard-state surface site density. The sum in the first exponent runs
only over the gas-phase species, and the sum in the second exponent runs
only over surface species.</p></li>
<li><p>For some simple surface reaction mechanisms, we have found it
convenient to specify the surface reaction rate constant in terms of
<em>sticking coefficient</em> or <em>sticking probability</em>, rather
than an actual reaction rate.</p></li>
<li><p>Conversion of a sticking coefficients <span
class="math inline">\gamma_i</span> to the usual mass-action kinetic
rate constants uses the collision frequency of the gas species with
solid surface, as <span class="math display">
k_{f_i} = \gamma_i\frac{\prod_i
\sigma_j^{\nu_{ij}&#39;}}{(\Gamma_{tot})^m}\sqrt{\frac{RT}{2\pi W_k}}
</span></p></li>
<li><p>Here, <span class="math inline">W_k</span> is teh molecular
weight of the gas-phase species, <span
class="math inline">\Gamma_{tot}</span> is the total surface site
concentration summed over all surface phases (nume of moles of surface
sites per unit area), and <span class="math inline">m</span> is the sum
of all stoichiometric coefficients of reactions that are surface
species.</p></li>
<li><p>The term involving <span class="math inline">\Gamma_{tot}</span>
raise to the <span class="math inline">m</span> power is needed to
convert from the unitless sticking coefficient from to units appropriate
for a rate constant, and the term in the square root accounts for the
gas/surface collision frequency. Here, <span
class="math inline">\sigma_j</span> is the number os sites for that
species occupies, and <span class="math inline">\nu_j</span> is the
reaction order for that species. The product term (<span
class="math inline">\prod \sigma_j \nu_{ij}</span>) will be equal to one
when there are unity site occupancies for all of the surface species in
the reaction.</p></li>
<li><p>Surface reactions are often described using global reactions
rather than as a series of elementary reactions. Some of the most common
global rate expressions used for surface reactions are the
Langmuir-Hinshelwood (LH) and Eley-Rideal (ER) rate
expressions.</p></li>
<li><p>The former applies to the case where adsorption and desorption
are assumed to be in equilibrium, and a reaction on the surface between
adsorbed species is rate determining.</p></li>
<li><p>The latter applies to the case of a reaction between a gas-phase
species and an adsorbed species being rate-limiting.</p></li>
<li><p>In solving chemically reacting-flow problems, chemical production
and destruction is often balanced by transport due to convection,
diffusion, or conduction. In some cases, such as perfectly stirred
reactors or plug-flow reactors, the determination of composition and
temperature fields are assumed to be kinetically limited. In such cases,
transport is assumed to be infinitely fast within the section of gas
considered and the effects of transport properties can be neglected. In
many other important cases, however, transport of species and energy can
become rate limiting.</p></li>
<li><p>For a 0-D homogeneous system, the molar production of species per
unit volume, <span class="math inline">P_k</span>, is given by <span
class="math display">
p_i = \dot{\omega_k} + \sum_m\frac{A_m}{V}\dot{s_{k,m}} = \sum_{i=1}^I
\nu_{k_i}q_i + \sum_{m=1}\frac{A_m}{V}\sum_{i=1}^{I_S}\nu_{k_i}^S q_i^S
</span> where the first and second terms of the right-hand side
corresponds to the gas and surface contributions, respectively.</p></li>
<li><p>Here, <span class="math inline">\nu_{k_i}</span> and <span
class="math inline">\nu_{k_k}^S</span> are the (net?) stoichiometric
coefficients of the gas and surface reaction, respectively, and <span
class="math inline">q_i</span> and <span
class="math inline">q_i^S</span> are the rate-of-progress of the
gas-phase and surface reactions.</p></li>
<li><p>The <span class="math inline">A_m/V</span> term accounts for the
surface-to-volume ratio, and it is needed to adjust the unit between
area-based reaction rate to the volume-based reaction rate.</p></li>
<li><p>Sensitivity analysis of a problem solution allows quantitative
understanding of how the solution depends on the various parameters
contained in a model.</p></li>
<li><p>The system of ordinary differential equations described for the
reactor models is generally stiff, which means that there is a large
disparity in time scales for evolution of different species in the
reactor system. Such systems are most efficiently solved by implicit
techniques for time integration.</p></li>
<li><p>Principle component analysis (PCA) employs an
eigenvalue-eigenvector analysis to extract kinetic information from
linear sensitivities calculated for species of a reacting
system.</p></li>
<li><p>It studies the effect on the calculated behavior of a reaction
mechanism brought about by a variation in the rate
coefficients.</p></li>
<li><p>The effect is most sensitive to changes in the rate coefficients
along teh principle axis that corresponds to the largest eigenvalue of
the sensitivity matrix and is least sensitive to changes along the axis
that corresponds to the smallest eigenvalue.</p></li>
<li><p>Therefore, teh reactions in the principle components with small
eigenvalues can be cropped.</p></li>
